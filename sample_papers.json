      "abstract": "Social robots are embodied agents that interact with people while following human communication norms. These robots interact using verbal and non-verbal cues, and share the physical environments of people. While social robots have previously utilized rule-based systems or probabilistic models for user interaction, the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to develop LLM-empowered social robots for enhanced human-robot interaction...",
