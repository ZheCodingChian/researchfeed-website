While Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their\nlimited sensitivity to local, fine-grained motion variations and lack of\ninherent inductive biases often hinder localization accuracy and\ngeneralization. Recent studies have shown that incorporating large-kernel\nconvolutions and Transformer-inspired architectural designs into CNN can\neffectively expand the receptive field, thereby improving global motion\nperception. Motivated by these insights, we propose a novel CNN-based module\ncalled the Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM), which adaptively captures\nboth global motion patterns and local, fine-grained motion features from\ndynamic inputs. This module dynamically generates selective weights based on\nthe input, enabling efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. To further\nimprove temporal modeling, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU),\nwhich selectively extracts representative and task-relevant motion features in\nthe temporal domain. This unit addresses the limitations of temporal modeling\nobserved in existing CNN approaches. Built upon DADM and STGU, we present a new\nCNN-based inertial odometry backbone, named Next Era of Inertial Odometry\n(IONext). Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that IONext\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer- and CNN-based\nmethods. For instance, on the RNIN dataset, IONext reduces the average ATE by\n10% and the average RTE by 12% compared to the representative model iMOT.",

We examine comprehensive\nweather-aware AI systems that integrate deep learning meteorological prediction\nwith machine learning positioning optimization, comparing their performance\nagainst traditional operations and route-only AI approaches. Using simulation\ndata from 10,000 taxi operations across varied weather conditions, we find that\nweather-aware AI systems increase driver revenue by 107.3\\%, compared to 14\\%\nimprovements from route-optimization alone. Weather prediction contributes the\nlargest individual productivity gain, with strong correlations between\nmeteorological conditions and demand ($r=0.575$). Economic analysis reveals\nannual earnings increases of 13.8 million yen per driver, with rapid payback\nperiods and superior return on investment. These findings suggest that current\nAI literature significantly underestimates AI's transformative potential by\nfocusing narrowly on routing algorithms, while weather intelligence represents\nan untapped \\$8.9 billion market opportunity.

While it is\noften assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's\nparameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL\nfine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of\nweights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced\nparameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity\nconstraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL\nalgorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI,\nMeta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show\nsubstantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far\nexceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the\npretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers\nfull model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully\nfine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL\noperates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted\nchanges. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited\neffect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts\nmodels: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small,\nconsistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods\nand reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular in various\nareas, traditional business gradually shifting from rule-based systems to\nLLM-based solutions. However, the inference of LLMs is resource-intensive or\nlatency-sensitive, posing significant challenges for serving systems. Existing\nLLM serving systems often use static or continuous batching strategies, which\ncan lead to inefficient GPU memory utilization and increased latency,\nespecially under heterogeneous workloads. These methods may also struggle to\nadapt to dynamic workload fluctuations, resulting in suboptimal throughput and\npotential service level objective (SLO) violations. In this paper, we introduce\nBucketServe, a bucket-based dynamic batching framework designed to optimize LLM\ninference performance. By grouping requests into size-homogeneous buckets based\non sequence length, BucketServe minimizes padding overhead and optimizes GPU\nmemory usage through real-time batch size adjustments preventing out-of-memory\n(OOM) errors. It introduces adaptive bucket splitting/merging and\npriority-aware scheduling to mitigate resource fragmentation and ensure SLO\ncompliance. Experiment shows that BucketServe significantly outperforms UELLM\nin throughput, achieving up to 3.58x improvement. It can also handle 1.93x more\nrequest load under the SLO attainment of 80% compared with DistServe and\ndemonstrates 1.975x higher system load capacity compared to the UELLM.",

The off-chain agent layer supports\nadaptive reasoning and local decision-making, while the on-chain blockchain\nlayer ensures immutable, transparent, and auditable enforcement of decisions\nvia smart contracts. The framework also incorporates a formal cross-layer\ncommunication protocol to bridge decentralized negotiation with institutional\nenforcement. A simulation environment emulating pandemic scenarios evaluates\nthe system's performance, demonstrating improvements in negotiation efficiency,\nfairness of allocation, supply chain responsiveness, and auditability.

Existing training-free acceleration strategies\nthat reduce per-step computation cost, while effectively reducing sampling\ntime, demonstrate low faithfulness compared to the original baseline. We\nhypothesize that this fidelity gap arises because (a) different prompts\ncorrespond to varying denoising trajectory, and (b) such methods do not\nconsider the underlying ODE formulation and its numerical solution. In this\npaper, we propose Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration (SADA), a\nnovel paradigm that unifies step-wise and token-wise sparsity decisions via a\nsingle stability criterion to accelerate sampling of ODE-based generative\nmodels (Diffusion and Flow-matching). For (a), SADA adaptively allocates\nsparsity based on the sampling trajectory. For (b), SADA introduces principled\napproximation schemes that leverage the precise gradient information from the\nnumerical ODE solver. Comprehensive evaluations on SD-2, SDXL, and Flux using\nboth EDM and DPM++ solvers reveal consistent $\\ge 1.8\\times$ speedups with\nminimal fidelity degradation (LPIPS $\\leq 0.10$ and FID $\\leq 4.5$) compared to\nunmodified baselines, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, SADA\nadapts seamlessly to other pipelines and modalities: It accelerates ControlNet\nwithout any modifications and speeds up MusicLDM by $1.8\\times$ with $\\sim\n0.01$ spectrogram LPIPS.",

      "abstract": "The significant morphological and distributional variability among\nsubcellular components poses a long-standing challenge for learning-based\norganelle segmentation models, significantly increasing the risk of biased\nfeature learning. Existing methods often rely on single mapping relationships,\noverlooking feature diversity and thereby inducing biased training. Although\nthe Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its\napplication to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The\nvariability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the\nlabel space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM\nfocuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained\nspatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations\nand cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing\npre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge\nto alleviate training bias from data imbalance. Specifically, we design a\nfeature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same\nfeature space and efficiently combine different representations. Moreover, we\npresent a cosine similarity matrix-based class prompt encoder to activate\nclass-specific features to recognize subcellular categories. Extensive\nexperiments on diverse subcellular image datasets demonstrate that ScSAM\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

In this work, we address the challenge of low-quality\ngeneration of low-probability modes in multi-agent joint prediction. To tackle\nthis issue, we propose a two-stage multi-agent interactive prediction framework\nnamed \\textit{keypoint-guided joint prediction after classification-aware\nmarginal proposal} (JAM). The first stage is modeled as a marginal prediction\nprocess, which classifies queries by trajectory type to encourage the model to\nlearn all categories of trajectories, providing comprehensive mode information\nfor the joint prediction module. The second stage is modeled as a joint\nprediction process, which takes the scene context and the marginal proposals\nfrom the first stage as inputs to learn the final joint distribution. We\nexplicitly introduce key waypoints to guide the joint prediction module in\nbetter capturing and leveraging the critical information from the initial\npredicted trajectories. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world\nWaymo Open Motion Dataset interactive prediction benchmark. The results show\nthat our approach achieves competitive performance. In particular, in the\nframework comparison experiments, the proposed JAM outperforms other prediction\nframeworks and achieves state-of-the-art performance in interactive trajectory\nprediction.

It is important to explore whether we can learn a\nuniversal and generalized model for various contrast enhancement tasks. In this\nwork, we observe that the common key factor of these tasks lies in the need of\nexposure and contrast adjustment, which can be well-addressed if high-dynamic\nrange (HDR) inputs are available. We hence collect 46,928 HDR raw images from\npublic sources, and render 328,496 sRGB images to build multi-exposure\nsequences (MES) and the corresponding pseudo sRGB ground-truths via\nmulti-exposure fusion. Consequently, we train a network to generate an MES from\na single sRGB image, followed by training another network to fuse the generated\nMES into an enhanced image. Our proposed method, namely UNiversal Image\nContrast Enhancer (UNICE), is free of costly human labeling. However, it\ndemonstrates significantly stronger generalization performance than existing\nimage contrast enhancement methods across and within different tasks, even\noutperforming manually created ground-truths in multiple no-reference image\nquality metrics.

DOOMGAN achieves\nover 20% higher attack success rates than baseline methods under stringent\nthresholds, along with 20% better elliptical iris structure generation and 30%\nimproved gaze consistency.

Explainable AI (XAI)\nmethods provide a solution to this problem by providing insights into the\ncauses of the predictions.

We evaluated our proposed algorithm against\nseveral other publicly available counterfactual explanation algorithms on 3\nmodern network intrusion datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this work also\npresents the first comparative analysis of existing counterfactual explanation\nalgorithms within the context of network intrusion detection systems. Our\nproposed method provide minimal, diverse counterfactual explanations out of the\ntested counterfactual explanation algorithms in a more efficient manner by\nreducing the time to generate explanations. We also demonstrate how\ncounterfactual explanations can provide actionable explanations by summarizing\nthem to create a set of global rules. These rules are actionable not only at\ninstance level but also at the global level for intrusion attacks. These global\ncounterfactual rules show the ability to effectively filter out incoming attack\nqueries which is crucial for efficient intrusion detection and defense\nmechanisms.",

      "abstract": "With the high density of printed circuit board (PCB) design and the high\nspeed of production, the traditional PCB defect detection model is difficult to\ntake into account the accuracy and computational cost, and cannot meet the\nrequirements of high accuracy and real-time detection of tiny defects.\nTherefore, in this paper, a multi-scale PCB defect detection method is improved\nwith YOLOv8 using a comprehensive strategy of tiny target sensitivity strategy,\nnetwork lightweighting and adaptive pruning, which is able to improve the\ndetection speed and accuracy by optimizing the backbone network, the neck\nnetwork and the detection head, the loss function and the adaptive pruning\nrate. Firstly, a Ghost-HGNetv2 structure with fewer parameters is used in the\nbackbone network, and multilevel features are used to extract image semantic\nfeatures to discover accurate defects. Secondly, we integrate C2f-Faster with\nsmall number of parameters in the neck section to enhance the ability of\nmulti-level feature fusion. Next, in the Head part, we design a new GCDetect\ndetection head, which allows the prediction of bounding boxes and categories to\nshare the weights of GroupConv, and uses a small number of grouping\nconvolutions to accomplish the regression and classification tasks, which\nsignificantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining the accuracy\nof detection. We also design the Inner-MPDIoU boundary loss function to improve\nthe detection and localization of tiny targets. Finally, the model was pruned\nby an optimized adaptive pruning rate to further reduce the complexity of the\nmodel. Experimental results show that the model exhibits advantages in terms of\naccuracy and speed. On the publicly available PCB defect dataset, mAP0.5\nreaches 99.32% and mAP0.5:0.9 reaches 75.18%, which is 10.13% higher compared\nto YOLOv8n.",

To\nevaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we\nexpand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness,\nOrder Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical\nevaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1,\nindicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding\nstructured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as\nthe amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination\nphenomenon.

Existing methods generally rely on single-level visual features,\nlimiting their ability to capture complex distortions in AIGC images. To\naddress this limitation, a multi-level visual representation paradigm is\nproposed with three stages, namely multi-level feature extraction, hierarchical\nfusion, and joint aggregation. Based on this paradigm, two networks are\ndeveloped. Specifically, the Multi-Level Global-Local Fusion Network (MGLF-Net)\nis designed for the perceptual quality assessment, extracting complementary\nlocal and global features via dual CNN and Transformer visual backbones. The\nMulti-Level Prompt-Embedded Fusion Network (MPEF-Net) targets Text-to-Image\ncorrespondence by embedding prompt semantics into the visual feature fusion\nprocess at each feature level. The fused multi-level features are then\naggregated for final evaluation. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate\noutstanding performance on both tasks, validating the effectiveness of the\nproposed multi-level visual assessment paradigm.",

      "abstract": "When synthesizing identities as face recognition training data, it is\ngenerally believed that large inter-class separability and intra-class\nattribute variation are essential for synthesizing a quality dataset. % This\nbelief is generally correct, and this is what we aim for. However, when\nincreasing intra-class variation, existing methods overlook the necessity of\nmaintaining intra-class identity consistency. % To address this and generate\nhigh-quality face training data, we propose Vec2Face+, a generative model that\ncreates images directly from image features and allows for continuous and easy\ncontrol of face identities and attributes. Using Vec2Face+, we obtain datasets\nwith proper inter-class separability and intra-class variation and identity\nconsistency using three strategies: 1) we sample vectors sufficiently different\nfrom others to generate well-separated identities; 2) we propose an AttrOP\nalgorithm for increasing general attribute variations; 3) we propose LoRA-based\npose control for generating images with profile head poses, which is more\nefficient and identity-preserving than AttrOP. % Our system generates VFace10K,\na synthetic face dataset with 10K identities, which allows an FR model to\nachieve state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world test sets. Scaling the\nsize to 4M and 12M images, the corresponding VFace100K and VFace300K datasets\nyield higher accuracy than the real-world training dataset, CASIA-WebFace, on\nfive real-world test sets. This is the first time a synthetic dataset beats the\nCASIA-WebFace in average accuracy. In addition, we find that only 1 out of 11\nsynthetic datasets outperforms random guessing (\\emph{i.e., 50\\%}) in twin\nverification and that models trained with synthetic identities are more biased\nthan those trained with real identities. Both are important aspects for future\ninvestigation. Code is available at https://github.com/HaiyuWu/Vec2Face_plus",

To deal with\nthis, we propose a dispatch-aware deep neural network (DA-DNN) that accelerates\nDC-OTS without relying on pre-solved labels. DA-DNN predicts line states and\npasses them through a differentiable DC-OPF layer, using the resulting\ngeneration cost as the loss function so that all physical network constraints\nare enforced throughout training and inference. In addition, we adopt a\ncustomized weight-bias initialization that keeps every forward pass feasible\nfrom the first iteration, which allows stable learning on large grids. Once\ntrained, the proposed DA-DNN produces a provably feasible topology and dispatch\npair in the same time as solving the DCOPF, whereas conventional mixed-integer\nsolvers become intractable. As a result, the proposed method successfully\ncaptures the economic advantages of OTS while maintaining scalability.",

Yet, little is known about how closely\nLLMs align with human moral judgments. To address this, we introduce the Moral\nDilemma Dataset, a benchmark of 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with a\ndistribution of human moral judgments consisting of a binary evaluation and a\nfree-text rationale. We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional\nalignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across\ndilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high\nconsensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In\nparallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions\nextracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral\nvalues than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch\nin both the distribution and diversity of values expressed. To close this gap,\nwe introduce Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), a Dirichlet-based sampling method\nthat conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles. DMP improves\nalignment by 64.3% and enhances value diversity, offering a step toward more\npluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs.",

We\nemploy the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm, fine-tuned on a public dataset\n(TimberSeg 1.0), to detect individual timber logs and estimate thickness\nthrough bounding-box dimensions. Unlike previous methods that require expensive\nsensors or controlled environments, this model is trained on images taken in\ntypical industrial sheds during timber delivery. Experimental results show that\nthe model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.64, demonstrating\nreliable log detection even with modest computing resources.

Dataset distillation mitigates this by\ncompressing an original dataset into a small set of synthetic samples, while\npreserving its full utility. Yet, existing methods either maximize performance\nunder fixed storage budgets or pursue suitable synthetic data representations\nfor redundancy removal, without jointly optimizing both objectives. In this\nwork, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset\ndistillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes\ndecoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of\nquantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss\nas the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier. To enable\nfair, cross-method comparisons, we introduce bits per class (bpc), a precise\nstorage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs. On\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128, our method achieves up to $170\\times$\ngreater compression than standard distillation at comparable accuracy. Across\ndiverse bpc budgets, distillation losses, and backbone architectures, our\napproach consistently establishes better rate-utility trade-offs.",

While SL reduces computational overhead on edge devices, it\nencounters significant challenges in heterogeneous environments where devices\nvary in computing resources, communication capabilities, environmental\nconditions, and privacy requirements. Although recent studies have explored\nheterogeneous SL frameworks that optimize split points for devices with varying\nresource constraints, they often neglect personalized privacy requirements and\nlocal model customization under varying environmental conditions. To address\nthese limitations, we propose P3SL, a Personalized Privacy-Preserving Split\nLearning framework designed for heterogeneous, resource-constrained edge device\nsystems. The key contributions of this work are twofold. First, we design a\npersonalized sequential split learning pipeline that allows each client to\nachieve customized privacy protection and maintain personalized local models\ntailored to their computational resources, environmental conditions, and\nprivacy needs. Second, we adopt a bi-level optimization technique that empowers\nclients to determine their own optimal personalized split points without\nsharing private sensitive information (i.e., computational resources,\nenvironmental conditions, privacy requirements) with the server. This approach\nbalances energy consumption and privacy leakage risks while maintaining high\nmodel accuracy. We implement and evaluate P3SL on a testbed consisting of 7\ndevices including 4 Jetson Nano P3450 devices, 2 Raspberry Pis, and 1 laptop,\nusing diverse model architectures and datasets under varying environmental\nconditions.",

State-of-the-art methods leverage either paired image-text data via\nvision-language pre-training or unpaired image data via self-supervised\npre-training to learn foundation models with generalizable image features to\nboost downstream task performance. However, learning foundation models\nexclusively on either paired or unpaired image data limits their ability to\nlearn richer and more comprehensive image features. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a novel task termed semi-supervised vision-language pre-training,\naiming to fully harness the potential of both paired and unpaired image data\nfor foundation model learning. To this end, we propose MaskedCLIP, a\nsynergistic masked image modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training\nframework for semi-supervised vision-language pre-training. The key challenge\nin combining paired and unpaired image data for learning a foundation model\nlies in the incompatible feature spaces derived from these two types of data.\nTo address this issue, we propose to connect the masked feature space with the\nCLIP feature space with a bridge transformer. In this way, the more semantic\nspecific CLIP features can benefit from the more general masked features for\nsemantic feature extraction. We further propose a masked knowledge distillation\nloss to distill semantic knowledge of original image features in CLIP feature\nspace back to the predicted masked image features in masked feature space. With\nthis mutually interactive design, our framework effectively leverages both\npaired and unpaired image data to learn more generalizable image features for\ndownstream tasks.

To reduce data transmission costs and enhance privacy, Federated\nLearning (FL) enables model training without the need to move or share raw\ndata. While FL offers these advantages, it also introduces challenges due to\nthe heterogeneity of data sources (related to volume and quality),\ncomputational node capabilities, and environmental impact.\n  This paper contributes to the advancement of Green AI by proposing a\ndata-centric approach to Green Federated Learning. Specifically, we focus on\nreducing FL's environmental impact by minimizing the volume of training data.\nOur methodology involves the analysis of the characteristics of federated\ndatasets, the selecting of an optimal subset of data based on quality metrics,\nand the choice of the federated nodes with the lowest environmental impact. We\ndevelop a comprehensive methodology that examines the influence of data-centric\nfactors, such as data quality and volume, on FL training performance and carbon\nemissions.

We evaluate DistrAttention with extensive\nexperiments. The results show that our method is 37% faster than\nFlashAttention-2 on calculating self-attention. In ViT inference,\nDistrAttention is the fastest and the most accurate among approximate\nself-attention mechanisms. In Llama3-1B, DistrAttention still achieves the\nlowest inference time with only 1% accuray loss.",

We observe that these difficulties\nstem from performing interaction directly on physical objects, where input is\ntightly coupled to their physical constraints. Our key insight is to decouple\ninteraction from these constraints by introducing proxies-abstract\nrepresentations of real-world objects. We embody this concept in Reality Proxy,\na system that seamlessly shifts interaction targets from physical objects to\ntheir proxies during selection. Beyond facilitating basic selection, Reality\nProxy uses AI to enrich proxies with semantic attributes and hierarchical\nspatial relationships of their corresponding physical objects, enabling novel\nand previously cumbersome interactions in MR - such as skimming,\nattribute-based filtering, navigating nested groups, and complex multi object\nselections - all without requiring new gestures or menu systems. We demonstrate\nReality Proxy's versatility across diverse scenarios, including office\ninformation retrieval, large-scale spatial navigation, and multi-drone control.\nAn expert evaluation suggests the system's utility and usability, suggesting\nthat proxy-based abstractions offer a powerful and generalizable interaction\nparadigm for future MR systems.",

Furthermore, we present a large-scale Radiometry Correction\nDataset, specifically designed to emphasize exposure variations, to facilitate\nunsupervised learning. In addition, we develop a transformation function that\npreserves image details and outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods\n[12], while utilizing only 0.01% of their parameters. Our work further\ninvestigates the broader impact of exposure correction on downstream tasks,\nincluding edge detection, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating the\nadverse effects of poor exposure on low-level features.

The process of prompt\nprogramming requires the developer to make many changes to their prompt.

With\nthe growing number of research and commercial prompt programming tools, it is\nunclear whether prompt programmers' needs are being adequately addressed. We\naddress these challenges by developing a taxonomy of 25 tasks prompt\nprogrammers do and 51 questions they ask, measuring the importance of each task\nand question. We interview 16 prompt programmers, observe 8 developers make\nprompt changes, and survey 50 developers. We then compare the taxonomy with 48\nresearch and commercial tools. We find that prompt programming is not\nwell-supported: all tasks are done manually, and 16 of the 51 questions --\nincluding a majority of the most important ones -- remain unanswered.

      "abstract": "Polarization images facilitate image enhancement and 3D reconstruction tasks,\nbut the limited accessibility of polarization cameras hinders their broader\napplication. This gap drives the need for synthesizing photorealistic\npolarization images. The existing polarization simulator Mitsuba relies on a\nparametric polarization image formation model and requires extensive 3D assets\ncovering shape and PBR materials, preventing it from generating large-scale\nphotorealistic images. To address this problem, we propose PolarAnything,\ncapable of synthesizing polarization images from a single RGB input with both\nphotorealism and physical accuracy, eliminating the dependency on 3D asset\ncollections. Drawing inspiration from the zero-shot performance of pretrained\ndiffusion models, we introduce a diffusion-based generative framework with an\neffective representation strategy that preserves the fidelity of polarization\nproperties. Experiments show that our model generates high-quality polarization\nimages and supports downstream tasks like shape from polarization.",

First,\nthe segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated\nprompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image\nsegmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second,\nproviding poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large)\nto the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask\nresults. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain\ngeneralization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully\nautomated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted\nGeneration Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty\nModeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module\nintegrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty\ndistribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding\nbox prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with\nSAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image\nembeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the\ntarget object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts. Extensive\nexperiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate\nthe effectiveness of FA-SAM and highlight its potential to address the above\nchallenges.",

To strike a good balance between\nresponse quality and latency, we design a user query router that can\nintelligently choose between (i) FastTrack mode: to handle simple requests that\nonly need additional relevant context retrieved from knowledge corpora; and\n(ii) FullAgentic mode: to handle complicated requests that need composite\nactions and tool invocations to proactively discover context across various\ncompliance artifacts, and/or involving other APIs/models for accommodating\nrequests. A typical example would be to start with a user query, use its\ndescription to find a specific entity and then use the entity's information to\nquery other APIs for curating and enriching the final AI response.\n  Our experimental evaluations compared CBA against an out-of-the-box LLM on\nvarious real-world privacy/compliance-related queries targeting various\npersonas. We found that CBA substantially improved upon the vanilla LLM's\nperformance on metrics such as average keyword match rate (83.7% vs. 41.7%) and\nLLM-judge pass rate (82.0% vs. 20.0%). We also compared metrics for the full\nrouting-based design against the `fast-track only` and `full-agentic` modes and\nfound that it had a better average match-rate and pass-rate while keeping the\nrun-time approximately the same. This finding validated our hypothesis that the\nrouting mechanism leads to a good trade-off between the two worlds.",

To address this limitation, we propose \\textbf{PointLAMA}, a point\ncloud pretraining framework that combines task-aware point cloud serialization,\na hybrid encoder with integrated Latent Attention and Mamba blocks, and a\nconditional diffusion mechanism built upon the Mamba backbone. Specifically,\nthe task-aware point cloud serialization employs Hilbert/Trans-Hilbert\nspace-filling curves and axis-wise sorting to structurally align point tokens\nfor classification and segmentation tasks, respectively. Our lightweight Latent\nAttention block features a Point-wise Multi-head Latent Attention (PMLA)\nmodule, which is specifically designed to align with the Mamba architecture by\nleveraging the shared latent space characteristics of PMLA and Mamba. This\nenables enhanced local context modeling while preserving overall efficiency. To\nfurther enhance representation learning, we incorporate a conditional diffusion\nmechanism during pretraining, which denoises perturbed feature sequences\nwithout relying on explicit point-wise reconstruction.

Conventional systems rely on a\ntwo-stage pipeline - audio tagging followed by label-conditioned source\nseparation - but are often constrained by the absence of fine-grained temporal\ninformation critical for effective separation. In this work, we address this\nlimitation by introducing a novel approach for S5 that enhances the synergy\nbetween the event detection and source separation stages. Our key contributions\nare threefold. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained Transformer to detect active\nsound classes. Second, we utilize a separate instance of this fine-tuned\nTransformer to perform sound event detection (SED), providing the separation\nmodule with detailed, time-varying guidance. Third, we implement an iterative\nrefinement mechanism that progressively enhances separation quality by\nrecursively reusing the separator's output from previous iterations. These\nadvancements lead to significant improvements in both audio tagging and source\nseparation performance, as demonstrated by our system's second-place finish in\nTask 4 of the DCASE Challenge 2025.

      "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of\nlarge language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during\ninference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead\ndue to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.\nExisting acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early\nstopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via\nspeculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers\nfrom limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,\nand fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing\nconcise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a\ntoken-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT\ninference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large\nlanguage model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to\ngenerate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's\nconfidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback\nand selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency\nand answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible\nwith standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks\ndemonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\\% reduction in inference latency\nwith negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in\naccelerating CoT reasoning.",

Such a criterion entails the sufficient and necessary identifiability\nconditions for IV validity. In the second stage, with the identified IV, we\npropose two candidate policy learning approaches: one is based on a simulator,\nwhile the other is offline.

      "abstract": "Semi-dense feature matching methods have shown strong performance in\nchallenging scenarios. However, the existing pipeline relies on a global search\nacross the entire feature map to establish coarse matches, limiting further\nimprovements in accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by this limitation, we\npropose a novel pipeline, CasP, which leverages cascaded correspondence priors\nfor guidance. Specifically, the matching stage is decomposed into two\nprogressive phases, bridged by a region-based selective cross-attention\nmechanism designed to enhance feature discriminability. In the second phase,\none-to-one matches are determined by restricting the search range to the\none-to-many prior areas identified in the first phase. Additionally, this\npipeline benefits from incorporating high-level features, which helps reduce\nthe computational costs of low-level feature extraction. The acceleration gains\nof CasP increase with higher resolution, and our lite model achieves a speedup\nof $\\sim2.2\\times$ at a resolution of 1152 compared to the most efficient\nmethod, ELoFTR. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority\nin geometric estimation, particularly with impressive cross-domain\ngeneralization. These advantages highlight its potential for latency-sensitive\nand high-robustness applications, such as SLAM and UAV systems. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/pq-chen/CasP.",

While current mainstream approaches to\ndigital humans primarily focus on 3D models and 2D video-based representations,\ninteractive 2D cartoon-style digital humans have received relatively less\nattention. Compared to 3D digital humans that require complex modeling and high\nrendering costs, and 2D video-based solutions that lack flexibility and\nreal-time interactivity, 2D cartoon-style Live2D models offer a more efficient\nand expressive alternative. By simulating 3D-like motion through layered\nsegmentation without the need for traditional 3D modeling, Live2D enables\ndynamic and real-time manipulation. In this technical report, we present\nCartoonAlive, an innovative method for generating high-quality Live2D digital\nhumans from a single input portrait image. CartoonAlive leverages the shape\nbasis concept commonly used in 3D face modeling to construct facial blendshapes\nsuitable for Live2D. It then infers the corresponding blendshape weights based\non facial keypoints detected from the input image. This approach allows for the\nrapid generation of a highly expressive and visually accurate Live2D model that\nclosely resembles the input portrait, within less than half a minute. Our work\nprovides a practical and scalable solution for creating interactive 2D cartoon\ncharacters, opening new possibilities in digital content creation and virtual\ncharacter animation.

Each human part, such\nas a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into\nothers. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to\ninfer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most\nexisting 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part\nsegmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions.\nIn this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a\nkey guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core\ncomponents. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we\npropose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially\nreconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based\non the textureless surface. Second, to incorporate part information into\ntexture reconstruction, we introduce a part-guided texturing module\n(PartTexturer), which acquires prior knowledge from a pre-trained image\ngeneration network on texture alignment of human parts. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human\nreconstruction. The project page is available at\nhttps://hygenie1228.github.io/PARTE/.",

To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS)\nframework that enables high-performance detection of weak targets without any\nmanual annotations.Instead of conventional frame-based detection, our framework\nreformulates the task as a pixel-wise temporal signal modeling problem, where\nweak targets manifest as short-duration pulse-like responses. A Temporal Signal\nReconstruction Network (TSRNet) is developed under the TPS paradigm to\nreconstruct these transient signals.TSRNet adopts an encoder-decoder\narchitecture and integrates a Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention)\nmodule to enhance its sensitivity to diverse temporal patterns. Additionally, a\ngraph-based trajectory mining strategy is employed to suppress false alarms and\nensure temporal consistency.Extensive experiments on a purpose-built low-SNR\ndataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nwhile requiring no human annotations. It achieves strong detection performance\nand operates at over 1000 FPS, underscoring its potential for real-time\ndeployment in practical scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Motion forecasting and planning are tasked with estimating the trajectories\nof traffic agents and the ego vehicle, respectively, to ensure the safety and\nefficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments.\nState-of-the-art methods typically adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm,\nwhere each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-mode\ntrajectories. While this paradigm can produce diverse motion intentions, it\noften falls short in modeling the intricate spatiotemporal evolution of\ntrajectories, which can lead to collisions or suboptimal outcomes. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose DeMo++, a framework that decouples motion\nestimation into two distinct components: holistic motion intentions to capture\nthe diverse potential directions of movement, and fine spatiotemporal states to\ntrack the agent's dynamic progress within the scene and enable a\nself-refinement capability. Further, we introduce a cross-scene trajectory\ninteraction mechanism to explore the relationships between motions in adjacent\nscenes. This allows DeMo++ to comprehensively model both the diversity of\nmotion intentions and the spatiotemporal evolution of each trajectory. To\neffectively implement this framework, we developed a hybrid model combining\nAttention and Mamba. This architecture leverages the strengths of both\nmechanisms for efficient scene information aggregation and precise trajectory\nstate sequence modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMo++ achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including motion\nforecasting (Argoverse 2 and nuScenes), motion planning (nuPlan), and\nend-to-end planning (NAVSIM).",

      "abstract": "Multimodal representation learning seeks to create a unified representation\nspace by integrating diverse data modalities to improve multimodal\nunderstanding. Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive\nlearning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment\nacross all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous\nalignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as\nlimitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from\noptimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this\npaper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel\nframework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without\nanchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the\ntheoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix,\nPMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to\nalign modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based\nloss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest\nsingular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the\nleading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents\nrepresentation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate\nPMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods. The source code will be\npublicly available.",

However, existing\nlarge-scale Transformer-based models (such as FoodSAM) face challenges in\nmeeting practical deploymentrequirements due to their massive parameter counts\nand high computational resource demands. This paper introduces TUNable Adapter\nmodule (Swin-TUNA), a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that\nintegrates multiscale trainable adapters into the Swin Transformer\narchitecture, achieving high-performance food image segmentation by updating\nonly 4% of the parameters. The core innovation of Swin-TUNA lies in its\nhierarchical feature adaptation mechanism: it designs separable convolutions in\ndepth and dimensional mappings of varying scales to address the differences in\nfeatures between shallow and deep networks, combined with a dynamic balancing\nstrategy for tasks-agnostic and task-specific features. Experiments demonstrate\nthat this method achieves mIoU of 50.56% and 74.94% on the FoodSeg103 and\nUECFoodPix Complete datasets, respectively, surpassing the fully parameterized\nFoodSAM model while reducing the parameter count by 98.7% (to only 8.13M).\nFurthermore, Swin-TUNA exhibits faster convergence and stronger generalization\ncapabilities in low-data scenarios, providing an efficient solution for\nassembling lightweight food image.",

This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined\nobjects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object\nDetection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only\nrecognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects.\nTo this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal\nAxis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning\nenhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from\nthe auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained\ndetector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal\naxes-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by\nestimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from\nmodel predictions. The proposed CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art\nperformances on SFUOD benchmarks, and extensive experiments validate its\neffectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen combinations\nof known objects and attributes by leveraging knowledge from previously seen\ncompositions. Traditional approaches primarily focus on disentangling\nattributes and objects, treating them as independent entities during learning.\nHowever, this assumption overlooks the semantic constraints and contextual\ndependencies inside a composition. For example, certain attributes naturally\npair with specific objects (e.g., \"striped\" applies to \"zebra\" or \"shirts\" but\nnot \"sky\" or \"water\"), while the same attribute can manifest differently\ndepending on context (e.g., \"young\" in \"young tree\" vs. \"young dog\"). Thus,\ncapturing attribute-object interdependence remains a fundamental yet\nlong-ignored challenge in CZSL. In this paper, we adopt a Conditional\nProbability Framework (CPF) to explicitly model attribute-object dependencies.\nWe decompose the probability of a composition into two components: the\nlikelihood of an object and the conditional likelihood of its attribute. To\nenhance object feature learning, we incorporate textual descriptors to\nhighlight semantically relevant image regions. These enhanced object features\nthen guide attribute learning through a cross-attention mechanism, ensuring\nbetter contextual alignment. By jointly optimizing object likelihood and\nconditional attribute likelihood, our method effectively captures compositional\ndependencies and generalizes well to unseen compositions. Extensive experiments\non multiple CZSL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Code\nis available at here.",

Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in\ngenerating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content, and improves\nthe performance of downstream task of polyp segmentation.

To ensure responsible\nand compliant deployment of CodeLLMs, training data detection (TDD) has become\na critical task. While recent TDD methods have shown promise in natural\nlanguage settings, their effectiveness on code data remains largely\nunderexplored. This gap is particularly important given code's structured\nsyntax and distinct similarity criteria compared to natural language. To\naddress this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of seven\nstate-of-the-art TDD methods on source code data, evaluating their performance\nacross eight CodeLLMs. To support this evaluation, we introduce CodeSnitch, a\nfunction-level benchmark dataset comprising 9,000 code samples in three\nprogramming languages, each explicitly labeled as either included or excluded\nfrom CodeLLM training. Beyond evaluation on the original CodeSnitch, we design\ntargeted mutation strategies to test the robustness of TDD methods under three\ndistinct settings.

Traditional methods often struggle with\nsubstantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets,\nthereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these\nconstraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages\npre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring\nfine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of\nMLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity\nand linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To\ncapitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP)\nmechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative\nhidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning.\nThen a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently\ndetects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate\nexplanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate\nthat HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional\napproaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model\ngeneralization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking\nthe potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the\nway for more practical and scalable solutions.",

To address this issue, we propose the first hyperbolic\nmodeling framework for PRVR, namely HLFormer, which leverages hyperbolic space\nlearning to compensate for the suboptimal hierarchical modeling capabilities of\nEuclidean space. Specifically, HLFormer integrates the Lorentz Attention Block\nand Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces,\nusing the Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module to dynamically fuse features.\nAdditionally, we introduce a Partial Order Preservation Loss to enforce \"text <\nvideo\" hierarchy through Lorentzian cone constraints. This approach further\nenhances cross-modal matching by reinforcing partial relevance between video\ncontent and text queries. Extensive experiments show that HLFormer outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods. Code is released at\nhttps://github.com/lijun2005/ICCV25-HLFormer.",

Moreover, these\nmethods are often evaluated on in-the-wild real world videos without\nground-truth data or on synthetic datasets, which fail to model the real world\nlight transport, camera motion, and pose-induced appearance and geometry\nchanges. To tackle these two problems, we introduce MoviCam, the first\nnon-synthetic dataset containing ground-truth camera trajectories of a\ndynamically moving monocular RGB camera, scene geometry, and 3D human motion\nwith human-scene contact labels. Additionally, we propose PhysDynPose, a\nphysics-based method that incorporates scene geometry and physical constraints\nfor more accurate human motion tracking in case of camera motion and non-flat\nscenes. More precisely, we use a state-of-the-art kinematics estimator to\nobtain the human pose and a robust SLAM method to capture the dynamic camera\ntrajectory, enabling the recovery of the human pose in the world frame. We then\nrefine the kinematic pose estimate using our scene-aware physics optimizer.\nFrom our new benchmark, we found that even state-of-the-art methods struggle\nwith this inherently challenging setting, i.e. a moving camera and non-planar\nenvironments, while our method robustly estimates both human and camera poses\nin world coordinates.",

Building on prior studies for tumor\ncharacterization via CBIR, this study advances CBIR research for volumetric\nmedical images through three key contributions: (1) a framework eliminating\nreliance on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, aligning with large\nand unstructured image archiving systems, i.e. PACS in clinical practice; (2)\nintroduction of C-MIR, a novel volumetric re-ranking method adapting ColBERT's\ncontextualized late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging; (3)\ncomprehensive evaluation across four tumor sites using three feature extractors\nand three database configurations. Our evaluations highlight the significant\nadvantages of C-MIR. We demonstrate the successful adaptation of the late\ninteraction principle to volumetric medical images, enabling effective\ncontext-aware re-ranking. A key finding is C-MIR's ability to effectively\nlocalize the region of interest, eliminating the need for pre-segmentation of\ndatasets and offering a computationally efficient alternative to systems\nrelying on expensive data enrichment steps. C-MIR demonstrates promising\nimprovements in tumor flagging, achieving improved performance, particularly\nfor colon and lung tumors (p<0.05). C-MIR also shows potential for improving\ntumor staging, warranting further exploration of its capabilities.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an\ninference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort\nfor parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model\narchitecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different\nbenefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity\ncalculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To\naddress this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by\ncombining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding\nRAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects\nretrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity;\nhowever, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG\ngenerates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then\nselects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average\nimprovements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG,\nrespectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models\nindicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various\ndomains.

A\nquery-based decoder head then employs learned object queries to concurrently\npredict object classes and instance masks in the BEV space. This mask-centric\nformulation effectively captures the footprint of both static and dynamic\nobjects regardless of their shape, offering a robust alternative to bounding\nbox regression.

Traditional retrieval-based methods for\ngeo-localization struggle with scalability and perceptual aliasing, while\nclassification-based approaches lack generalization and require extensive\ntraining data. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer a\npromising alternative by leveraging contextual understanding and reasoning.\nHowever, while VLMs achieve high accuracy, they are often prone to\nhallucinations and lack interpretability, making them unreliable as standalone\nsolutions. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid geo-localization framework\nthat combines the strengths of VLMs with retrieval-based visual place\nrecognition (VPR) methods. Our approach first leverages a VLM to generate a\nprior, effectively guiding and constraining the retrieval search space. We then\nemploy a retrieval step, followed by a re-ranking mechanism that selects the\nmost geographically plausible matches based on feature similarity and proximity\nto the initially estimated coordinates. We evaluate our approach on multiple\ngeo-localization benchmarks and show that it consistently outperforms prior\nstate-of-the-art methods, particularly at street (up to 4.51%) and city level\n(up to 13.52%).

However,\nthe high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely\nconstrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies\nlike Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful\nstrategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view\nsequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we\npropose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation\nframework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on\nsingle-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core\nchallenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic\nviews and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low\ncomputational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical\nobjects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of\ninnovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we\nintroduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that\nlearns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints.\nSecond, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse\nSpatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views\nand remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the\nviews to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation,\nwe incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large\nLanguage Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted\nexpert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of\nVLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.",

Beyond\nreporting performance metrics, we aim to interpret what these results reveal\nabout the underlying possibilities and limitations of the VE task. We conduct a\nseries of experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings,\nexploring how factors such as prompt design, the number and order of in-context\nexamples and access to visual information might affect VE performance. To\nfurther probe the reasoning processes of the model, we used explanation-based\nevaluations. Results indicate that three-shot inference outperforms the\nzero-shot baselines. However, additional examples introduce more noise than\nthey provide benefits. Additionally, the order of the labels in the prompt is a\ncritical factor that influences the predictions. In the absence of visual\ninformation, the model has a strong tendency to hallucinate and imagine\ncontent, raising questions about the model's over-reliance on linguistic\npriors. Fine-tuning yields strong results, achieving an accuracy of 83.3% on\nthe e-SNLI-VE dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art OFA-X model.\nAdditionally, the explanation evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model\nprovides semantically meaningful explanations similar to those of humans, with\na BERTScore F1-score of 89.2%. We do, however, find comparable BERTScore\nresults in experiments with limited vision, questioning the visual grounding of\nthis task.

Despite this progress, the formidable cost of fabricating\nlarge-scale quantum processors means they will remain rare for the foreseeable\nfuture, limiting their widespread application. To address this bottleneck, we\nintroduce the concept of predictive surrogates, which are classical learning\nmodels designed to emulate the mean-value behavior of a given quantum processor\nwith provably computational efficiency. In particular, we propose two\npredictive surrogates that can substantially reduce the need for quantum\nprocessor access in diverse practical scenarios. To demonstrate their potential\nin advancing digital quantum simulation, we use these surrogates to emulate a\nquantum processor with up to 20 programmable superconducting qubits, enabling\nefficient pre-training of variational quantum eigensolvers for families of\ntransverse-field Ising models and identification of non-equilibrium Floquet\nsymmetry-protected topological phases. Experimental results reveal that the\npredictive surrogates not only reduce measurement overhead by orders of\nmagnitude, but can also surpass the performance of conventional,\nquantum-resource-intensive approaches. Collectively, these findings establish\npredictive surrogates as a practical pathway to broadening the impact of\nadvanced quantum processors.",

MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories:\nlanguage-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition\nreasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition\nreasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English\nequivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation\nfrom native speakers fluent in English. This set of English equivalents can\nprovide a direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity in other languages vs.\nEnglish on the same reasoning questions. We systematically evaluate current 14\nleading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent\nset. The results show that (1) current LLMs are still not good at native\nmultilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC; (2) LLMs\nexhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses in handling linguistic, cultural, and\nlogical reasoning tasks; (3) Most models perform substantially better in math\nreasoning in English compared to in original languages (+10%), indicating\npersistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge.",

The model is then optimized\nprogressively across these stages. In addition, we conduct a series of\npreliminary studies to validate the core design assumptions and provide strong\nempirical motivation for the proposed framework.

Recent studies have attempted to address this problem by converting\nthe complex 3D spatial scenes into 2D image super-resolution tasks. However,\ndue to the sparse and blurry feature representation of range images, accurately\nreconstructing detailed and complex spatial topologies remains a major\ndifficulty. To tackle this, we propose a novel sparse point cloud upsampling\nmethod named SRMambaV2, which enhances the upsampling accuracy in long-range\nsparse regions while preserving the overall geometric reconstruction quality.\nSpecifically, inspired by human driver visual perception, we design a\nbiomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention (2DSSA) mechanism to model the\nfeature distribution in distant sparse areas. Meanwhile, we introduce a\ndual-branch network architecture to enhance the representation of sparse\nfeatures. In addition, we introduce a progressive adaptive loss (PAL) function\nto further refine the reconstruction of fine-grained details during the\nupsampling process. Experimental results demonstrate that SRMambaV2 achieves\nsuperior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,\nhighlighting its effectiveness and practical value in automotive sparse point\ncloud upsampling tasks.",

While some progress has been made, existing methods continue\nto struggle with removing large-scale flare artifacts and repairing structural\ndamage in regions near the light source. We observe that these challenging\nflare artifacts exhibit more significant discrepancies from the reference\nimages in the frequency domain compared to the spatial domain. Therefore, this\npaper presents a novel dynamic frequency-guided deflare network (DFDNet) that\ndecouples content information from flare artifacts in the frequency domain,\neffectively removing large-scale flare artifacts. Specifically, DFDNet consists\nmainly of a global dynamic frequency-domain guidance (GDFG) module and a local\ndetail guidance module (LDGM). The GDFG module guides the network to perceive\nthe frequency characteristics of flare artifacts by dynamically optimizing\nglobal frequency domain features, effectively separating flare information from\ncontent information. Additionally, we design an LDGM via a contrastive learning\nstrategy that aligns the local features of the light source with the reference\nimage, reduces local detail damage from flare removal, and improves\nfine-grained image restoration. The experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of\nperformance.

      "abstract": "In next-generation communications and networks, machine learning (ML) models\nare expected to deliver not only accurate predictions but also well-calibrated\nconfidence scores that reflect the true likelihood of correct decisions. This\npaper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor\nwithin a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish\nkey theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under\nperfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources\ngrows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected\noutput conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast,\nwhen only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall\nexpected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated\npredictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to\nachieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability\nrequirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot\nimprove the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new\ninformation about future channel states. Additionally, we show that\nwell-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that\nnecessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition\nthat the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to\noccur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous\nsimulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt\nscaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is\ntrained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system.\nFurthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with\ntemporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver\nmobility.",

In this\npaper, we introduce a Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT), which is\nmeticulously engineered to overcome this limitation enabling seamless training\nwith vanilla mSGDW while yielding comparable performance to the Transformers\ntrained via AdamW. To be specific, in DNT, we strategically integrate\nnormalization techniques at proper positions in the Transformers to effectively\nmodulate the Jacobian matrices of each layer, balance the influence of weights,\nactivations, and their interactions, and thus enable the distributions of\ngradients concentrated. We provide both theoretical justifications of the\nnormalization technique used in our DNT and extensive empirical evaluation on\ntwo popular Transformer architectures to validate that: a) DNT outperforms its\ncounterparts (\\ie, ViT and GPT), and b) DNT can be effectively trained with\nvanilla mSGDW.",

However, parallel inference introduces significant\ncommunication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices,\nlimiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression\nframework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation\nquality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong\ntemporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations,\nsaturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information.\nTo address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that\nencodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via\nResidual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise\nactivation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical\njustification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling\nsubstantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate\nlightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion\nestablishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower\nlatency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On\n4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also\nuniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on\nslow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method.\nCompactFusion applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings,\nand integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework.

Yet, the majority of recent generative models assume trivial\ngeometry (e.g., Euclidean) and rely on strong density-estimation assumptions,\nyielding trajectories that do not respect the true principles of optimality in\nthe underlying manifold. We present Hamiltonian Optimal Transport Advection\n(HOTA), a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman based method that tackles the dual dynamical\nOT problem explicitly through Kantorovich potentials, enabling efficient and\nscalable trajectory optimization. Our approach effectively evades the need for\nexplicit density modeling, performing even when the cost functionals are\nnon-smooth. Empirically, HOTA outperforms all baselines in standard benchmarks,\nas well as in custom datasets with non-differentiable costs, both in terms of\nfeasibility and optimality.",

This separation creates a complex,\nresource-intensive pipeline and suffers from a performance ceiling due to a\nstatic reward signal. We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy\nOptimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following (\"player\") and reward\nmodeling (\"referee\") within a single model and a single training phase. Our\nmethod recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable\nreasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format\noptimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This\nenables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic\nwhile simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks.\nExperiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified\nmodel significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative\nreward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24\nto 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66. Furthermore,\nURPO cultivates a superior internal evaluator as a byproduct of training,\nachieving a RewardBench score of 85.15 and surpassing the dedicated reward\nmodel it replaces (83.55). By eliminating the need for a separate reward model\nand fostering a co-evolutionary dynamic between generation and evaluation, URPO\npresents a simpler, more efficient, and more effective path towards robustly\naligned language models.",

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce InstructVLA, an end-to-end VLA model that preserves the flexible\nreasoning of large vision-language models (VLMs) while delivering leading\nmanipulation performance. InstructVLA introduces a novel training paradigm,\nVision-Language-Action Instruction Tuning (VLA-IT), which employs multimodal\ntraining with mixture-of-experts adaptation to jointly optimize textual\nreasoning and action generation on both standard VLM corpora and a curated\n650K-sample VLA-IT dataset. On in-domain SimplerEnv tasks, InstructVLA achieves\n30.5% improvement over SpatialVLA. To evaluate generalization, we introduce\nSimplerEnv-Instruct, an 80-task benchmark requiring closed-loop control and\nhigh-level instruction understanding, where it outperforms a fine-tuned OpenVLA\nby 92% and an action expert aided by GPT-4o by 29%. Additionally, InstructVLA\nsurpasses baseline VLMs on multimodal tasks and exhibits inference-time scaling\nby leveraging textual reasoning to boost manipulation performance in both\nsimulated and real-world settings.

      "abstract": "Building energy modeling is a key tool for optimizing the performance of\nbuilding energy systems. Historically, a wide spectrum of methods has been\nexplored -- ranging from conventional physics-based models to purely\ndata-driven techniques. Recently, hybrid approaches that combine the strengths\nof both paradigms have gained attention. These include strategies such as\nlearning surrogates for physics-based models, modeling residuals between\nsimulated and observed data, fine-tuning surrogates with real-world\nmeasurements, using physics-based outputs as additional inputs for data-driven\nmodels, and integrating the physics-based output into the loss function the\ndata-driven model. Despite this progress, two significant research gaps remain.\nFirst, most hybrid methods focus on deterministic modeling, often neglecting\nthe inherent uncertainties caused by factors like weather fluctuations and\noccupant behavior. Second, there has been little systematic comparison within a\nprobabilistic modeling framework. This study addresses these gaps by evaluating\nfive representative hybrid approaches for probabilistic building energy\nmodeling, focusing on quantile predictions of building thermodynamics in a\nreal-world case study. Our results highlight two main findings. First, the\nperformance of hybrid approaches varies across different building room types,\nbut residual learning with a Feedforward Neural Network performs best on\naverage. Notably, the residual approach is the only model that produces\nphysically intuitive predictions when applied to out-of-distribution test data.\nSecond, Quantile Conformal Prediction is an effective procedure for calibrating\nquantile predictions in case of indoor temperature modeling.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in multi-modal pre-training methods have shown promising\neffectiveness in learning 3D representations by aligning multi-modal features\nbetween 3D shapes and their corresponding 2D counterparts. However, existing\nmulti-modal pre-training frameworks primarily rely on a single pre-training\ntask to gather multi-modal data in 3D applications. This limitation prevents\nthe models from obtaining the abundant information provided by other relevant\ntasks, which can hinder their performance in downstream tasks, particularly in\ncomplex and diverse domains. In order to tackle this issue, we propose MMPT, a\nMulti-modal Multi-task Pre-training framework designed to enhance point cloud\nunderstanding. Specifically, three pre-training tasks are devised: (i)\nToken-level reconstruction (TLR) aims to recover masked point tokens, endowing\nthe model with representative learning abilities. (ii) Point-level\nreconstruction (PLR) is integrated to predict the masked point positions\ndirectly, and the reconstructed point cloud can be considered as a transformed\npoint cloud used in the subsequent task. (iii) Multi-modal contrastive learning\n(MCL) combines feature correspondences within and across modalities, thus\nassembling a rich learning signal from both 3D point cloud and 2D image\nmodalities in a self-supervised manner. Moreover, this framework operates\nwithout requiring any 3D annotations, making it scalable for use with large\ndatasets. The trained encoder can be effectively transferred to various\ndownstream tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluated its\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods in various discriminant and\ngenerative applications under widely-used benchmarks.",

However, they face critical challenges in\nspecialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of\nannotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which\nhinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert,\nan ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning\ncapabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the\nintelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and\nleverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease\nclassification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis\nwithin a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically\naligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable\nreasoning paths.

      "abstract": "One of the most practical and challenging types of black-box adversarial\nattacks is the hard-label attack, where only the top-1 predicted label is\navailable. One effective approach is to search for the optimal ray direction\nfrom the benign image that minimizes the $\\ell_p$-norm distance to the\nadversarial region. The unique advantage of this approach is that it transforms\nthe hard-label attack into a continuous optimization problem. The objective\nfunction value is the ray's radius, which can be obtained via binary search at\na high query cost. Existing methods use a \"sign trick\" in gradient estimation\nto reduce the number of queries. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the\nquality of this gradient estimation and propose a novel prior-guided approach\nto improve ray search efficiency both theoretically and empirically.\nSpecifically, we utilize the transfer-based priors from surrogate models, and\nour gradient estimators appropriately integrate them by approximating the\nprojection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and\nrandom directions, in a query-efficient manner. We theoretically derive the\nexpected cosine similarities between the obtained gradient estimators and the\ntrue gradient, and demonstrate the improvement achieved by incorporating\npriors. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets show that\nour approach significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods in terms of\nquery efficiency.",

It involves multiple rounds of communication\nbetween the global model and participating clients, which introduces several\nchallenges like high communication costs, heterogeneous client data, prolonged\nprocessing times, and increased vulnerability to privacy threats. In recent\nyears, the convergence of federated learning and parameterized quantum circuits\nhas sparked significant research interest, with promising implications for\nfields such as healthcare and finance.

Recognizing that\nFisher information can quantify the amount of information that a quantum state\ncarries under parameter changes, thereby providing insight into its geometric\nand statistical properties. We intend to leverage this property to address the\naforementioned challenges. In this work, we propose a Quantum Federated\nLearning (QFL) algorithm that makes use of the Fisher information computed on\nlocal client models, with data distributed across heterogeneous partitions.\nThis approach identifies the critical parameters that significantly influence\nthe quantum model's performance, ensuring they are preserved during the\naggregation process.

During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and\nreconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich\ncross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate\ntraining-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss\nthat enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches.\nExtensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves\nsuperior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art\napproaches.",

Compared to\ntraditional explicit representations, such as TSDF, it improves the mapping\ncompleteness and memory efficiency. However, the lack of reconstruction details\nand the time-consuming learning of neural representations hinder the widespread\napplication of neural-based methods to large-scale online reconstruction. We\nintroduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene\nreconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and\nlarge-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a\nresidual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and\nan implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained\ndetails to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for\ndetail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting\nwith the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus\npaving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the\nresidual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via\nbundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize\nposes directly, we opt to optimize pose changes. Combined with a novel\ntechnique for adaptive gradient amplification, our method attains better\noptimization convergence and global optimality. Furthermore, we adopt a local\nmoving volume to factorize the mixed scene representation with a\ndivide-and-conquer design to facilitate efficient online learning in our\nresidual-based framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nsurpasses all state-of-the-art ones, including those based either on explicit\nor implicit representations, in terms of the accuracy of both mapping and\ntracking on large-scale scenes.",

      "abstract": "As surgery embraces digital transformation--integrating sophisticated\nimaging, advanced algorithms, and robotics to support and automate complex\nsub-tasks--human judgment of system correctness remains a vital safeguard for\npatient safety. This shift introduces new \"operator-type\" roles tasked with\nverifying complex algorithmic outputs, particularly at critical junctures of\nthe procedure, such as the intermediary check before drilling or implant\nplacement. A prime example is 2D/3D registration, a key enabler of image-based\nsurgical navigation that aligns intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D\ndata. Although registration algorithms have advanced significantly, they\noccasionally yield inaccurate results. Because even small misalignments can\nlead to revision surgery or irreversible surgical errors, there is a critical\nneed for robust quality assurance. Current visualization-based strategies alone\nhave been found insufficient to enable humans to reliably detect 2D/3D\nregistration misalignments. In response, we propose the first artificial\nintelligence (AI) framework trained specifically for 2D/3D registration quality\nverification, augmented by explainability features that clarify the model's\ndecision-making. Our explainable AI (XAI) approach aims to enhance informed\ndecision-making for human operators by providing a second opinion together with\na rationale behind it. Through algorithm-centric and human-centered\nevaluations, we systematically compare four conditions: AI-only, human-only,\nhuman-AI, and human-XAI. Our findings reveal that while explainability features\nmodestly improve user trust and willingness to override AI errors, they do not\nexceed the standalone AI in aggregate performance. Nevertheless, future work\nextending both the algorithmic design and the human-XAI collaboration elements\nholds promise for more robust quality assurance of 2D/3D registration.",

Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have\ndemonstrated remarkable capabilities in computer vision tasks, yet their\nalignment with human visual attention patterns remains underexplored,\nparticularly in aesthetic contexts. This study investigates the correlation\nbetween human visual attention and ViT attention mechanisms when evaluating\nhandcrafted objects. We conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 30\nparticipants (9 female, 21 male, mean age 24.6 years) who viewed 20 artisanal\nobjects comprising basketry bags and ginger jars. Using a Pupil Labs\neye-tracker, we recorded gaze patterns and generated heat maps representing\nhuman visual attention. Simultaneously, we analyzed the same objects using a\npre-trained ViT model with DINO (Self-DIstillation with NO Labels), extracting\nattention maps from each of the 12 attention heads. We compared human and ViT\nattention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying\nGaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal\ncorrelation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest\nalignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found\nbetween attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest\ndivergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test). Results indicate\nthat while ViTs exhibit more global attention patterns compared to human focal\nattention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior,\nparticularly for specific object features like buckles in basketry items. These\nfindings suggest potential applications of ViT attention mechanisms in product\ndesign and aesthetic evaluation, while highlighting fundamental differences in\nattention strategies between human perception and current AI models.",

In this work,\nwe introduce CNS-Bench, a Continuous Nuisance Shift Benchmark to quantify OOD\nrobustness of image classifiers for continuous and realistic generative\nnuisance shifts. CNS-Bench allows generating a wide range of individual\nnuisance shifts in continuous severities by applying LoRA adapters to diffusion\nmodels. To address failure cases, we propose a filtering mechanism that\noutperforms previous methods, thereby enabling reliable benchmarking with\ngenerative models. With the proposed benchmark, we perform a large-scale study\nto evaluate the robustness of more than 40 classifiers under various nuisance\nshifts. Through carefully designed comparisons and analyses, we find that model\nrankings can change for varying shifts and shift scales, which cannot be\ncaptured when applying common binary shifts. Additionally, we show that\nevaluating the model performance on a continuous scale allows the\nidentification of model failure points, providing a more nuanced understanding\nof model robustness.

Our interpretation sheds light on common operations involving\nattention scores such as selection, summation, and averaging in a unified\nframework. It further extends them by considering indirect attention,\npropagated through the Markov chain, as opposed to previous studies that only\nmodel immediate effects. Our main observation is that tokens corresponding to\nsemantically similar regions form a set of metastable states, where the\nattention clusters, while noisy attention scores tend to disperse. Metastable\nstates and their prevalence can be easily computed through simple matrix\nmultiplication and eigenanalysis, respectively. Using these lightweight tools,\nwe demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation. Lastly, we define\nTokenRank -- the steady state vector of the Markov chain, which measures global\ntoken importance. We demonstrate that using it brings improvements in\nunconditional image generation. We believe our framework offers a fresh view of\nhow tokens are being attended in modern visual transformers.",

Extensive\nexperiments show that Synergos-VQA decisively establishes a new\nstate-of-the-art on three challenging benchmarks, including OK-VQA and A-OKVQA.\nFurthermore, our approach demonstrates strong plug-and-play capabilities,\nsignificantly boosting various open-source MLLMs and proving that superior\nmethodological design can outperform sheer model scale.",

Existing methods\nadopt a single-stage framework that aims to simultaneously achieve visible\nregion segmentation and occluded region hallucination, while also being\naffected by inaccurate depth estimation. Such methods often achieve suboptimal\nperformance, especially in complex scenes. We propose a novel two-stage\nframework that decomposes MSSC into coarse MSSC followed by the Masked\nRecurrent Network. Specifically, we propose the Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent\nUnit (MS-GRU) which concentrates on the occupied regions by the proposed mask\nupdating mechanism, and a sparse GRU design is proposed to reduce the\ncomputation cost. Additionally, we propose the distance attention projection to\nreduce projection errors by assigning different attention scores according to\nthe distance to the observed surface. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed unified framework, MonoMRN, effectively supports both indoor and\noutdoor scenes and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYUv2 and\nSemanticKITTI datasets. Furthermore, we conduct robustness analysis under\nvarious disturbances, highlighting the role of the Masked Recurrent Network in\nenhancing the model's resilience to such challenges.

These\nblocks are integrated into the deeper stages of MambaVision, allowing the model\nto progressively adjust feature emphasis through dynamic expert gating,\neffectively mitigating the limitations of traditional Transformer models.\nEvaluated on the CBIS-DDSM benchmark dataset, Mammo-Mamba achieves superior\nclassification performance across all key metrics while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency.",

Meta-learning shows particular promise\nfor reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are often adapted from\nsupervised or unsupervised learning despite their suboptimality for RL.\nHowever, until now there has been a severe lack of comparison between different\nmeta-learning algorithms, such as using evolution to optimise over black-box\nfunctions or LLMs to propose code. In this paper, we carry out this empirical\ncomparison of the different approaches when applied to a range of meta-learned\nalgorithms which target different parts of the RL pipeline. In addition to\nmeta-train and meta-test performance, we also investigate factors including the\ninterpretability, sample cost and train time for each meta-learning algorithm.\nBased on these findings, we propose several guidelines for meta-learning new RL\nalgorithms which will help ensure that future learned algorithms are as\nperformant as possible.",

Many existing\nmethods learn motion from single image pairs consisting of a reference frame\nand a randomly selected target frame from the cardiac cycle. However, these\nmethods overlook the continuous nature of cardiac motion and often yield\ninconsistent and non-smooth motion estimations. In this work, we propose a\nnovel Mamba-based cardiac motion tracking network (MCM) that explicitly\nincorporates target image sequence from the cardiac cycle to achieve smooth and\ntemporally consistent motion tracking. By developing a bi-directional Mamba\nblock equipped with a bi-directional scanning mechanism, our method facilitates\nthe estimation of plausible deformation fields. With our proposed motion\ndecoder that integrates motion information from frames adjacent to the target\nframe, our method further enhances temporal coherence. Moreover, by taking\nadvantage of Mamba's structured state-space formulation, the proposed method\nlearns the continuous dynamics of the myocardium from sequential images without\nincreasing computational complexity. We evaluate the proposed method on two\npublic datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method\nquantitatively and qualitatively outperforms both conventional and\nstate-of-the-art learning-based cardiac motion tracking methods.

To enable\nalternative, simulation-based exploration of different stakeholder\nperspectives, we develop the HoPeS (Human-Oriented Perspective Shifting)\nmodelling framework. HoPeS employs agents powered by large language models\n(LLMs) to represent various stakeholders; users can step into the agent roles\nto experience perspectival differences. A simulation protocol serves as a\n\"scaffold\" to streamline multiple perspective-taking simulations, supporting\nusers in reflecting on, transitioning between, and integrating across\nperspectives. A prototype system is developed to demonstrate HoPeS in the\ncontext of institutional dynamics and land use change, enabling both\nnarrative-driven and numerical experiments. In an illustrative experiment, a\nuser successively adopts the perspectives of a system observer and a researcher\n- a role that analyses data from the embedded land use model to inform\nevidence-based decision-making for other LLM agents representing various\ninstitutions. Despite the user's effort to recommend technically sound\npolicies, discrepancies persist between the policy recommendation and\nimplementation due to stakeholders' competing advocacies, mirroring real-world\nmisalignment between researcher and policymaker perspectives. The user's\nreflection highlights the subjective feelings of frustration and disappointment\nas a researcher, especially due to the challenge of maintaining political\nneutrality while attempting to gain political influence. Despite this, the user\nexhibits high motivation to experiment with alternative narrative framing\nstrategies, suggesting the system's potential in exploring different\nperspectives. Further system and protocol refinement are likely to enable new\nforms of interdisciplinary collaboration in socio-ecological simulations.",

      "abstract": "Learning with noisy labels is a crucial task for training accurate deep\nneural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various\nrobust loss functions, particularly symmetric losses. Nevertheless, symmetric\nlosses usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict\nconstraint. To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly\noptimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting\nability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding\nadvanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging\ntheoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust\nloss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses.\nHowever, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced\noptimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and\napplicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric\nlosses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario\nand propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss. We\nrigorously establish the necessary and sufficient condition under which AMSE\nsatisfies the asymmetric condition. By substituting the traditional symmetric\npassive loss in APL with our proposed AMSE, we introduce a novel robust loss\nframework termed Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL). Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method in mitigating label noise. Code available at:\nhttps://github.com/cswjl/joint-asymmetric-loss",

In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel agentic paradigm that combines LLMs with\nreal-time optimization algorithms towards Trustworthy AI, defined as symbiotic\nagents. Optimizers at the LLM's input-level provide bounded uncertainty\nsteering for numerically precise tasks, whereas output-level optimizers\nsupervised by the LLM enable adaptive real-time control. We design and\nimplement two novel agent types including: (i) Radio Access Network optimizers,\nand (ii) multi-agent negotiators for Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). We\nfurther propose an end-to-end architecture for AGI networks and evaluate it on\na 5G testbed capturing channel fluctuations from moving vehicles. Results show\nthat symbiotic agents reduce decision errors fivefold compared to standalone\nLLM-based agents, while smaller language models (SLM) achieve similar accuracy\nwith a 99.9% reduction in GPU resource overhead and in near-real-time loops of\n82 ms. A multi-agent demonstration for collaborative RAN on the real-world\ntestbed highlights significant flexibility in service-level agreement and\nresource allocation, reducing RAN over-utilization by approximately 44%.\nDrawing on our findings and open-source implementations, we introduce the\nsymbiotic paradigm as the foundation for next-generation, AGI-driven\nnetworks-systems designed to remain adaptable, efficient, and trustworthy even\nas LLMs advance.",

Using deidentified data from over 21,000 clinical encounters,\nprepared in accordance with the HIPAA safe harbor standard, from a deployed AI\nmedical scribe system, we show that our feedback-derived checklist outperforms\nbaseline approaches in our offline evaluations in coverage, diversity, and\npredictive power for human ratings.

In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how\ndifferent forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral\ncompressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of\ncompression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the\nrepresentation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective\nperturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound,\nrevealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\\infty$ and $L_2$\nrobustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the\nvulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved -\nwhether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics.\nThrough empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm\nour theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities\npersist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the\nemergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a\nfundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and\nsuggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure.",

      "abstract": "State-of-the-art visual under-canopy navigation methods are designed with\ndeep learning-based perception models to distinguish traversable space from\ncrop rows. While these models have demonstrated successful performance, they\nrequire large amounts of training data to ensure reliability in real-world\nfield deployment. However, data collection is costly, demanding significant\nhuman resources for in-field sampling and annotation. To address this\nchallenge, various data augmentation techniques are commonly employed during\nmodel training, such as color jittering, Gaussian blur, and horizontal flip, to\ndiversify training data and enhance model robustness. In this paper, we\nhypothesize that utilizing only these augmentation techniques may lead to\nsuboptimal performance, particularly in complex under-canopy environments with\nfrequent occlusions, debris, and non-uniform spacing of crops. Instead, we\npropose a novel augmentation method, so-called Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut)\nwhich masks random regions out in input images that are spatially distributed\naround crop rows on the sides to encourage trained models to capture high-level\ncontextual features even when fine-grained information is obstructed. Our\nextensive experiments with a public cornfield dataset demonstrate that\nmasking-based augmentations are effective for simulating occlusions and\nsignificantly improving robustness in semantic keypoint predictions for visual\nnavigation. In particular, we show that biasing the mask distribution toward\ncrop rows in CA-Cut is critical for enhancing both prediction accuracy and\ngeneralizability across diverse environments achieving up to a 36.9% reduction\nin prediction error. In addition, we conduct ablation studies to determine the\nnumber of masks, the size of each mask, and the spatial distribution of masks\nto maximize overall performance.",

To support this\nmechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw\nmeshes into part-labeled sparse voxels.

We propose a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that\ntransforms any existing QA dataset into structured adversarial debates--where\none model is given the official answer to defend, and another constructs and\ndefends an alternative answer--adjudicated by a judge model blind to the\ncorrect solution. By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach\nsubstantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet\nreuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions:\n(1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based\nassessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's\neffectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized\nprotocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of\nthe method and its effectiveness against data contamination--a Llama 3.1 model\nfine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% -> 82%)\nbut performed worse in debates. Results also show that even weaker judges can\nreliably differentiate stronger debaters, highlighting how debate-based\nevaluation can scale to future, more capable systems while maintaining a\nfraction of the cost of creating new benchmarks.

Our findings indicate that large\nlearning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and regularization\nmethods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem. In addition to\ndemonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across diverse\nspurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present strong\nevidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates in\nstandard classification tasks is related to addressing hidden/rare spurious\ncorrelations in the training dataset.

      "abstract": "When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers,\nthe order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance\nmitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method\nthat adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each\ninstance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two\ntasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a\ndynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of\n81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based\nadaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of\n87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off\nrelative to our original early-stopping method.",

It\nachieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such\nas DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and\ncompositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme\nallows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including\nsubject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense\nprediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we\nincorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and\nspeculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.\nExtensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)\ndemonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses\ndiffusion-based models.

However, these models still face significant challenges when\nhandling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with\ndistinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first\noutlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose\nDetail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail\nInjection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose\na complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the\ngeneration process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent\nlayout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global\ncomposition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding\nbetween attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention\nmechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to\nreduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments\non T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark\ndemonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,\nparticularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic\nconditions.",

Because soil N has\nhigh spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate\nthe N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the\nindividual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used\nin-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of\nfour different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over\ntwo growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N\nconcentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two\nfeature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral\nbands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral\nbands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models,\nGradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The\ncomparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets\nshowed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection\nmethods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level\ndatasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm,\nand 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral\nregions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction\ndemonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level\ndata and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets\nof selected spectral bands for each analysis level.

      "abstract": "Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range\ndependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.\nHowever, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to\nhigh-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research\nfocus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which\ncomputes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While\neffective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for\nhigh-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated\nNeighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its\nsuccess in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local\nprecision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,\neffectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,\nour preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local\ndesign to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,\nprimarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local\nattention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that\ncomplements local attention, effectively integrating global context without\nsacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based\narchitecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive\nresults across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for\ndiverse low-level computer vision problems.",

Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts\nacross diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for\nresilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for\ngenerating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically\ngenerated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are\noften too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual\nrepresentation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts\nachieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative\nadversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths\nof both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid\nred-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted\nadversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics\nand attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average\nattack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded\ndataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic\nlocations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28\nentropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of\nhuman-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine\ncomputational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for\ncontinuous T2I model safety evaluation.",

Yet existing methods face key\nlimitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep\nlearning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language\nModels (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial\nstructure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points\nof Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their\nutility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep\nlearning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow\npredictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal\ngraph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model\nmulti-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across\nurban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:\npretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and\nreinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS\nrecords from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,\nUrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban\nforecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.",

      "abstract": "Memorization in generative models extends far beyond verbatim text\nreproduction--it manifests through non-literal patterns, semantic associations,\nand surprisingly, across modalities in transcript-conditioned generation tasks\nsuch as Lyrics-to-Song (L2S) and Text-to-Video (T2V) models. We reveal a new\nclass of cross-modality memorization where models trained on these tasks leak\ncopyrighted content through indirect, phonetic pathways invisible to\ntraditional text-based analysis. In this work, we introduce Adversarial\nPhoneTic Prompting (APT), an attack that replaces iconic phrases with\nhomophonic alternatives--e.g., \"mom's spaghetti\" becomes \"Bob's\nconfetti\"--preserving the acoustic form while largely changing semantic\ncontent. We demonstrate that models can be prompted to regurgitate memorized\nsongs using phonetically similar but semantically unrelated lyrics. Despite the\nsemantic drift, black-box models like SUNO and open-source models like YuE\ngenerate outputs that are strikingly similar to the original\nsongs--melodically, rhythmically, and vocally--achieving high scores on\nAudioJudge, CLAP, and CoverID. These effects persist across genres and\nlanguages. More surprisingly, we find that phonetic prompts alone can trigger\nvisual memorization in text-to-video models: when given altered lyrics from\nLose Yourself, Veo 3 generates scenes that mirror the original music\nvideo--complete with a hooded rapper and dim urban settings--despite no\nexplicit visual cues in the prompt. This cross-modality leakage represents an\nunprecedented threat: models memorize deep, structural patterns that transcend\ntheir training modality, making traditional safety measures like copyright\nfilters ineffective. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in\ntranscript-conditioned generative models and raise urgent concerns around\ncopyright, provenance, and secure deployment of multimodal generation systems.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written\nmaterials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving\nthe creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.\nAdversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit\ndetectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have\nmainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying\naccuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature\nabout DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we\ninvestigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text\nClassifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can\nconsistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed\nto the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a\ndetector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)\nfor classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored\nquestion-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses\nusing DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied\nadversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more\nsamples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy\nimpact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on\noriginal and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text\nClassifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack\nwas humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and\n52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best\nfive-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human\nrecall 100%).",

Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained\nlocal details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation\nerrors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature\nRefinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining\nhighresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR\nalso integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained\nstructures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object\ndelineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information\nthrough uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its\nlightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,\nleading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves\nexisting UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --\> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on\nSynthia--\>Cityscapes.

While the personalization of dynamic\nconcepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single\nvideo, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning,\nlimiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic\nconcept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages\nstructured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs,\nenabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and\ncomposition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module\ncompletes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and\nidentity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a\nsingle forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without\nany test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and\nconsistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and\nediting scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning have led to robust automated tools for\nsegmentation of abdominal computed tomography (CT). Meanwhile, segmentation of\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is substantially more challenging due to the\ninherent signal variability and the increased effort required for annotating\ntraining datasets. Hence, existing approaches are trained on limited sets of\nMRI sequences, which might limit their generalizability. To characterize the\nlandscape of MRI abdominal segmentation tools, we present here a comprehensive\nbenchmarking of the three state-of-the-art and open-source models:\nMRSegmentator, MRISegmentator-Abdomen, and TotalSegmentator MRI. Since these\nmodels are trained using labor-intensive manual annotation cycles, we also\nintroduce and evaluate ABDSynth, a SynthSeg-based model purely trained on\nwidely available CT segmentations (no real images). More generally, we assess\naccuracy and generalizability by leveraging three public datasets (not seen by\nany of the evaluated methods during their training), which span all major\nmanufacturers, five MRI sequences, as well as a variety of subject conditions,\nvoxel resolutions, and fields-of-view. Our results reveal that MRSegmentator\nachieves the best performance and is most generalizable. In contrast, ABDSynth\nyields slightly less accurate results, but its relaxed requirements in training\ndata make it an alternative when the annotation budget is limited. The\nevaluation code and datasets are given for future benchmarking at\nhttps://github.com/deepakri201/AbdoBench, along with inference code and weights\nfor ABDSynth.",

In this short paper, we\nfurther improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the\ndataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better\ncomputational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and\na post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to\nenhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of\nthe proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic\ndatasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the\nprediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original\nimplementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can\neffectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic\ndataset.

      "abstract": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational tools has\nthe potential to substantially impact how teachers plan instruction, support\ndiverse learners, and engage in professional reflection. Yet little is known\nabout how educators actually use these tools in practice and how their\ninteractions with AI can be meaningfully studied at scale. This paper presents\na human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of\nover 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by\nK-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive\ntheme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model\nbenchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the\nperformance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical\ncodebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing\neducators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies.\nOur findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably\nsupport theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios,\nand outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability.\nThe analysis also reveals substantive patterns in how educators inquire AI to\nenhance instructional practices (79.7 percent of total conversations), create\nor adapt content (76.1 percent), support assessment and feedback loop (46.9\npercent), attend to student needs for tailored instruction (43.3 percent), and\nassist other professional responsibilities (34.2 percent), highlighting\nemerging AI-related competencies that have direct implications for teacher\npreparation and professional development. This study offers a scalable,\ntransparent model for AI-augmented qualitative research and provides\nfoundational insights into the evolving role of generative AI in educational\npractice.",

This project introduces an automated system\nfor real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection\nmodels to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five\nYOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of\n1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and\ncrickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior\nbalance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes\nvideo footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal\ninterpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific\nbehaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was\nless accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).\nFuture improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded\ndatasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a\nscalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,\nsignificantly improving research efficiency and data quality.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, advanced deep learning architectures have shown strong\nperformance in medical imaging tasks. However, the traditional centralized\nlearning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and\ntrained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized\napproaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing\nmodel training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these\nmethods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data\nand suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the\naggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of\nclinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously\nlearning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and\ndecentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system\nexpansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To\naddress these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning\nframework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30\ndatasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved\nan overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and\nswarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions\ndue to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated\nstrong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after\nexpansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its\nresilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational\ncosts by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming\nits superior efficiency and scalability.",

      "abstract": "Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human\nmobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban\ngovernance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to\npredict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory\non a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,\nthe vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason\nover maps \\textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent\ndevelopment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong\ncapabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a\nnew possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an\nimage and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to\nperform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we\nfirst propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which\nevaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based\nreasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights\nfrom the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor,\nwhich is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and\ntrajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual\ninputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual\nMap Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction\nability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on\ndatasets from four different cities show that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city\ngeneralization compared to other LLM-based approaches.",

This connectivity, while powerful, introduces novel\nsecurity risks. One such risk is a cascading risk: a breach in one agent can\ncascade through the system, compromising others by exploiting inter-agent\ntrust. In tandem with OWASP's initiative for an Agentic AI Vulnerability\nScoring System we define an attack vector, Agent Cascading Injection, analogous\nto Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius, operating across networks of agents. In\nan ACI attack, a malicious input or tool exploit injected at one agent leads to\ncascading compromises and amplified downstream effects across agents that trust\nits outputs. We formalize this attack with an adversarial goal equation and key\nvariables (compromised agent, injected exploit, polluted observations, etc.),\ncapturing how a localized vulnerability can escalate into system-wide failure.\nWe then analyze ACI's properties -- propagation chains, amplification factors,\nand inter-agent compound effects -- and map these to OWASP's emerging Agentic\nAI risk categories (e.g. Impact Chain and Orchestration Exploits). Finally, we\nargue that ACI highlights a critical need for quantitative benchmarking\nframeworks to evaluate the security of agent-to-agent communication protocols.\nWe outline a methodology for stress-testing multi-agent systems (using\narchitectures such as Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP) against cascading trust\nfailures, developing upon groundwork for measurable, standardized\nagent-to-agent security evaluation.

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of induction machines has traditionally relied on model-based\nmethods that require the development of complex dynamic models, making them\ndifficult to implement and computationally expensive. To overcome these\nlimitations, this paper proposes a model-free approach using Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) for fault diagnosis in induction machines. The focus is on\ndetecting multiple fault types -- including eccentricity, bearing defects, and\nbroken rotor bars -- under varying severity levels and load conditions. Unlike\ntraditional approaches, raw current and vibration signals are used as direct\ninputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing or manual feature\nextraction. The proposed GNN-ASE model automatically learns and extracts\nrelevant features from raw inputs, leveraging the graph structure to capture\ncomplex relationships between signal types and fault patterns. It is evaluated\nfor both individual fault detection and multi-class classification of combined\nfault conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed model, achieving 92.5\\% accuracy for eccentricity defects, 91.2\\% for\nbearing faults, and 93.1\\% for broken rotor bar detection. These findings\nhighlight the model's robustness and generalization capability across different\noperational scenarios. The proposed GNN-based framework offers a lightweight\nyet powerful solution that simplifies implementation while maintaining high\ndiagnostic performance. It stands as a promising alternative to conventional\nmodel-based diagnostic techniques for real-world induction machine monitoring\nand predictive maintenance.",

      "abstract": "Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, enabling independent\nverification and validation of empirical findings. The topic gained prominence\nin fields such as psychology and medicine, where concerns about non -\nreplicable results sparked ongoing discussions about research practices. In\nrecent years, the fast-growing field of Machine Learning (ML) has become part\nof this discourse, as it faces similar concerns about transparency and\nreliability. Some reproducibility issues in ML research are shared with other\nfields, such as limited access to data and missing methodological details. In\naddition, ML introduces specific challenges, including inherent nondeterminism\nand computational constraints. While reproducibility issues are increasingly\nrecognized by the ML community and its major conferences, less is known about\nhow these challenges manifest in applied disciplines. This paper contributes to\nclosing this gap by analyzing the transparency and reproducibility standards of\nML applications in building energy systems. The results indicate that nearly\nall articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key\ndimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the\ndataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available. Only two papers\nshare a link to their code - one of which was broken. Two-thirds of the\npublications were authored exclusively by academic researchers, yet no\nsignificant differences in reproducibility were observed compared to\npublications with industry-affiliated authors. These findings highlight the\nneed for targeted interventions, including reproducibility guidelines, training\nfor researchers, and policies by journals and conferences that promote\ntransparency and reproducibility.",

The\nprotocol is grounded in five operational principles: Awareness, Integrity,\nJudgment, Ethical Responsibility, and Transparency (AIJET). A randomized\ncontrolled trial (n=151) demonstrated that a minimal 3-minute intervention\nproduced statistically significant improvements in cognitive security task\nperformance, with participants showing an absolute +7.87% gains compared to\ncontrols. These results suggest that brief, principles-based training can\nrapidly enhance human resilience against AI-driven cognitive manipulation. We\nrecommend that GenAI platforms embed \"Think First, Verify Always\" as a standard\nprompt, replacing passive warnings with actionable protocols to enhance\ntrustworthy and ethical AI use. By bridging the gap between technical\ncybersecurity and human factors, the TFVA protocol establishes human-empowered\nsecurity as a vital component of trustworthy AI systems.",

Early, accurate detection is essential to prevent\ncardiovascular complications, yet current monitoring methods are either\ninvasive or rely on subjective symptom reporting, limiting applicability in\ndaily file. This study presents a non-invasive, explainable machine learning\nframework for detecting AD using multimodal wearable sensors. Data were\ncollected from 27 individuals with chronic SCI during urodynamic studies,\nincluding electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), bioimpedance\n(BioZ), temperature, respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR), across three\ncommercial devices. Objective AD labels were derived from synchronized\ncuff-based BP measurements. Following signal preprocessing and feature\nextraction, BorutaSHAP was used for robust feature selection, and SHAP values\nfor explainability. We trained modality- and device-specific weak learners and\naggregated them using a stacked ensemble meta-model. Cross-validation was\nstratified by participants to ensure generalizability. HR- and ECG-derived\nfeatures were identified as the most informative, particularly those capturing\nrhythm morphology and variability. The Nearest Centroid ensemble yielded the\nhighest performance (Macro F1 = 0.77+/-0.03), significantly outperforming\nbaseline models. Among modalities, HR achieved the highest area under the curve\n(AUC = 0.93), followed by ECG (0.88) and PPG (0.86). RR and temperature\nfeatures contributed less to overall accuracy, consistent with missing data and\nlow specificity. The model proved robust to sensor dropout and aligned well\nwith clinical AD events. These results represent an important step toward\npersonalized, real-time monitoring for individuals with SCI.",
