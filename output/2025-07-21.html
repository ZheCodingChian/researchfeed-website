      "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of pheochromocytoma (PCC) in abdominal CT scans is\nessential for tumor burden estimation, prognosis, and treatment planning. It\nmay also help infer genetic clusters, reducing reliance on expensive testing.\nThis study systematically evaluates anatomical priors to identify\nconfigurations that improve deep learning-based PCC segmentation. We employed\nthe nnU-Net framework to evaluate eleven annotation strategies for accurate 3D\nsegmentation of pheochromocytoma, introducing a set of novel multi-class\nschemes based on organ-specific anatomical priors. These priors were derived\nfrom adjacent organs commonly surrounding adrenal tumors (e.g., liver, spleen,\nkidney, aorta, adrenal gland, and pancreas), and were compared against a broad\nbody-region prior used in previous work. The framework was trained and tested\non 105 contrast-enhanced CT scans from 91 patients at the NIH Clinical Center.\nPerformance was measured using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Normalized\nSurface Distance (NSD), and instance-wise F1 score. Among all strategies, the\nTumor + Kidney + Aorta (TKA) annotation achieved the highest segmentation\naccuracy, significantly outperforming the previously used Tumor + Body (TB)\nannotation across DSC (p = 0.0097), NSD (p = 0.0110), and F1 score (25.84%\nimprovement at an IoU threshold of 0.5), measured on a 70-30 train-test split.\nThe TKA model also showed superior tumor burden quantification (R^2 = 0.968)\nand strong segmentation across all genetic subtypes. In five-fold\ncross-validation, TKA consistently outperformed TB across IoU thresholds (0.1\nto 0.5), reinforcing its robustness and generalizability. These findings\nhighlight the value of incorporating relevant anatomical context into deep\nlearning models to achieve precise PCC segmentation, offering a valuable tool\nto support clinical assessment and longitudinal disease monitoring in PCC\npatients.",

While Late gadolinium\nenhancement (LGE) MRI is the clinical gold standard for infarct detection, it\nrequires contrast agents, introducing side effects and patient discomfort.\nMoreover, infarct reconstruction from LGE often relies on sparsely sampled 2D\nslices, limiting spatial resolution and accuracy. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework for automatically reconstructing high-fidelity 3D myocardial\ninfarct geometry from 2D clinically standard cine MRI, eliminating the need for\ncontrast agents. Specifically, we first reconstruct the 4D biventricular mesh\nfrom multi-view cine MRIs via an automatic deep shape fitting model, biv-me.\nThen, we design a infarction reconstruction model, CMotion2Infarct-Net, to\nexplicitly utilize the motion patterns within this dynamic geometry to localize\ninfarct regions. Evaluated on 205 cine MRI scans from 126 MI patients, our\nmethod shows reasonable agreement with manual delineation.

MeshMamba is efficient and scalable in handling a large\nnumber of input tokens, enabling the generation and reconstruction of body mesh\nmodels with more than 10,000 vertices, capturing clothing and hand geometries.\nThe key to effectively learning MeshMamba is the serialization technique of\nmesh vertices into orderings that are easily processed by Mamba. This is\nachieved by sorting the vertices based on body part annotations or the 3D\nvertex locations of a template mesh, such that the ordering respects the\nstructure of articulated shapes. Based on MeshMamba, we design 1) MambaDiff3D,\na denoising diffusion model for generating 3D articulated meshes and 2)\nMamba-HMR, a 3D human mesh recovery model that reconstructs a human body shape\nand pose from a single image. Experimental results showed that MambaDiff3D can\ngenerate dense 3D human meshes in clothes, with grasping hands, etc., and\noutperforms previous approaches in the 3D human shape generation task.\nAdditionally, Mamba-HMR extends the capabilities of previous non-parametric\nhuman mesh recovery approaches, which were limited to handling body-only poses\nusing around 500 vertex tokens, to the whole-body setting with face and hands,\nwhile achieving competitive performance in (near) real-time.",

It has proven\nespecially effective for discriminative tasks, surpassing the trending\ngenerative models. However, generative models perform better in image\ngeneration and detail enhancement. Thus, it is natural for us to find a\nconnection between SSL and generative models to further enhance the\nrepresentation capacity of SSL. As generative models can create new samples by\napproximating the data distribution, such modeling should also lead to a\nsemantic understanding of the raw visual data, which is necessary for\nrecognition tasks. This enlightens us to combine the core principle of the\ndiffusion model: diffusion noise, with SSL to learn a competitive recognition\nmodel. Specifically, diffusion noise can be viewed as a particular state of\nmask that reveals a close relationship between masked image modeling (MIM) and\ndiffusion models. In this paper, we propose N-JEPA (Noise-based JEPA) to\nincorporate diffusion noise into MIM by the position embedding of masked\ntokens. The multi-level noise schedule is a series of feature augmentations to\nfurther enhance the robustness of our model. We perform a comprehensive study\nto confirm its effectiveness in the classification of downstream tasks. Codes\nwill be released soon in public.",

Our\nresults show that PromptArmor can accurately identify and remove injected\nprompts. For example, using GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, or o4-mini, PromptArmor achieves\nboth a false positive rate and a false negative rate below 1% on the AgentDojo\nbenchmark. Moreover, after removing injected prompts with PromptArmor, the\nattack success rate drops to below 1%. We also demonstrate PromptArmor's\neffectiveness against adaptive attacks and explore different strategies for\nprompting an LLM. We recommend that PromptArmor be adopted as a standard\nbaseline for evaluating new defenses against prompt injection attacks.",

We validate our framework on real\nworld datasets, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods in\nmodeling complex vascular networks.

SIMD intrinsic programming, a trade-off between\ncoding productivity and high performance, is widely used in the development of\nmainstream performance-critical libraries and daily computing tasks. Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated strong and comprehensive\ncapabilities in code generation, show promise in assisting programmers with the\nchallenges of SIMD intrinsic programming. However, existing code-generation\nbenchmarks focus on only scalar code, and it is unclear how LLMs perform in\ngenerating vectorized code using SIMD intrinsics. To fill this gap, we propose\nSimdBench, the first code benchmark specifically designed for SIMD-intrinsic\ncode generation, comprising 136 carefully crafted tasks and targeting five\nrepresentative SIMD intrinsics: SSE (x86 Streaming SIMD Extension), AVX (x86\nAdvanced Vector Extension), Neon (ARM Advanced SIMD Extension), SVE (ARM\nScalable Vector Extension), and RVV (RISC-V Vector Extension). We conduct a\nsystematic evaluation (measuring both correctness and performance) of 18\nrepresentative LLMs on SimdBench, resulting in a series of novel and insightful\nfindings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a universal\ndecrease in pass@k during SIMD-intrinsic code generation compared to\nscalar-code generation. Our in-depth analysis highlights promising directions\nfor the further advancement of LLMs in the challenging domain of SIMD-intrinsic\ncode generation.

In this work, we introduce \\textbf{Delta\nProver}, an agent-based framework that orchestrates the interaction between a\ngeneral-purpose LLM and the Lean 4 proof environment.

At its core, the agent integrates two novel,\ninterdependent components: an algorithmic framework for reflective\ndecomposition and iterative proof repair, and a custom Domain-Specific Language\n(DSL) built upon Lean 4 for streamlined subproblem management. \\textbf{Delta\nProver achieves a state-of-the-art 95.9\\% success rate on the miniF2F-test\nbenchmark, surpassing all existing approaches, including those requiring model\nspecialization.} Furthermore, Delta Prover exhibits a significantly stronger\ntest-time scaling law compared to standard Best-of-N proof strategies.\nCrucially, our findings demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs, when guided by\nan effective agentic structure, possess substantial untapped theorem-proving\ncapabilities.

Existing alternatives typically require\neither per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training\nspecialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets.\nSuch dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their\npractical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully\nleverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers\n(e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this\ngap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates\nDiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal\nattention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while\npreserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis\nof DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly\nimproves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic\nrepresentations. Extensive experiments reflect that our method successfully\nunlocks DiT's zero-shot ability for consistent subject synthesis across diverse\ncontexts, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable results compared to\napproaches that require additional training.

This endeavor is fueled\nby smartphones as well as technologies like industrial internet of things,\nextended reality (XR), and human-to-machine (H2M) collaborations for fostering\nindustrial and social revolutions like Industry 4.0/5.0 and Society 5.0. To\nensure an ideal immersive experience and avoid cyber-sickness for users in all\nthe aforementioned usage scenarios, it is typically challenging to synchronize\nXR content from a remote machine to a human collaborator according to their\nhead movements across a large geographic span in real-time over communication\nnetworks. Thus, we propose a novel H2M collaboration scheme where the human's\nhead movements are predicted ahead with highly accurate models like\nbidirectional long short-term memory networks to orient the machine's camera in\nadvance. We validate that XR frame size varies in accordance with the human's\nhead movements and predict the corresponding bandwidth requirements from the\nmachine's camera to propose a human-machine coordinated dynamic bandwidth\nallocation (HMC-DBA) scheme. Through extensive simulations, we show that\nend-to-end latency and jitter requirements of XR frames are satisfied with much\nlower bandwidth consumption over enterprise networks like\nFiber-To-The-Room-Business.

      "abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a foundational role in modern cardiovascular\ncare, enabling non-invasive diagnosis of arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and\nconduction disorders. While machine learning has achieved expert-level\nperformance in ECG interpretation, the development of clinically deployable\nmultimodal AI systems remains constrained, primarily due to the lack of\npublicly available datasets that simultaneously incorporate raw signals,\ndiagnostic images, and interpretation text. Most existing ECG datasets provide\nonly single-modality data or, at most, dual modalities, making it difficult to\nbuild models that can understand and integrate diverse ECG information in\nreal-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce MEETI (MIMIC-IV-Ext\nECG-Text-Image), the first large-scale ECG dataset that synchronizes raw\nwaveform data, high-resolution plotted images, and detailed textual\ninterpretations generated by large language models. In addition, MEETI includes\nbeat-level quantitative ECG parameters extracted from each lead, offering\nstructured parameters that support fine-grained analysis and model\ninterpretability. Each MEETI record is aligned across four components: (1) the\nraw ECG waveform, (2) the corresponding plotted image, (3) extracted feature\nparameters, and (4) detailed interpretation text. This alignment is achieved\nusing consistent, unique identifiers. This unified structure supports\ntransformer-based multimodal learning and supports fine-grained, interpretable\nreasoning about cardiac health. By bridging the gap between traditional signal\nanalysis, image-based interpretation, and language-driven understanding, MEETI\nestablished a robust foundation for the next generation of explainable,\nmultimodal cardiovascular AI. It offers the research community a comprehensive\nbenchmark for developing and evaluating ECG-based AI systems.",

      "abstract": "The rapid proliferation and growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to\nthe development of federated learning (FL). FL allows wireless devices (WDs) to\ncooperatively learn by sharing only local model parameters, without needing to\nshare the entire dataset. However, the emergence of large AI models has made\nexisting FL approaches inefficient, due to the significant communication\noverhead required. In this paper, we propose a novel over-the-air federated\ndistillation (FD) framework by synergizing the strength of FL and knowledge\ndistillation to avoid the heavy local model transmission. Instead of sharing\nthe model parameters, only the WDs' model outputs, referred to as knowledge,\nare shared and aggregated over-the-air by exploiting the superposition property\nof the multiple-access channel. We shall study the transceiver design in\nover-the-air FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting\nthe power constraints of the transceivers. The main challenge lies in the\nintractability of the learning performance analysis, as well as the non-convex\nnature and the optimization spanning the whole FD training period. To tackle\nthis problem, we first derive an analytical expression of the convergence rate\nin over-the-air FD. Then, the closed-form optimal solutions of the WDs'\ntransmit power and the estimator for over-the-air aggregation are obtained\ngiven the receiver combining strategy. Accordingly, we put forth an efficient\napproach to find the optimal receiver beamforming vector via semidefinite\nrelaxation. We further prove that there is no optimality gap between the\noriginal and relaxed problem for the receiver beamforming design. Numerical\nresults will show that the proposed over-the-air FD approach achieves a\nsignificant reduction in communication overhead, with only a minor compromise\nin testing accuracy compared to conventional FL benchmarks.",

The differential perspective-n-point (PnP) has been widely used to\nsupervise I2P registration networks by enforcing the projective constraints on\n2D-3D correspondences. However, differential PnP is highly sensitive to noise\nand outliers in the predicted correspondences. This issue hinders the\neffectiveness of correspondence learning. Inspired by the robustness of blind\nPnP against noise and outliers in correspondences, we propose an approximated\nblind PnP based correspondence learning approach. To mitigate the high\ncomputational cost of blind PnP, we simplify blind PnP to an amenable task of\nminimizing Chamfer distance between learned 2D and 3D keypoints, called\nMinCD-PnP. To effectively solve MinCD-PnP, we design a lightweight multi-task\nlearning module, named as MinCD-Net, which can be easily integrated into the\nexisting I2P registration architectures. Extensive experiments on 7-Scenes,\nRGBD-V2, ScanNet, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that MinCD-Net\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves a higher inlier ratio (IR)\nand registration recall (RR) in both cross-scene and cross-dataset settings.",

However, as detection\nmethods improve, attack techniques become increasingly sophisticated. Attacks\non face recognition systems can be broadly divided into physical and digital\napproaches. Traditionally, deep learning models have been the primary defence\nagainst such attacks. While these models perform exceptionally well in\nscenarios for which they have been trained, they often struggle to adapt to\ndifferent types of attacks or varying environmental conditions. These\nsubsystems require substantial amounts of training data to achieve reliable\nperformance, yet biometric data collection faces significant challenges,\nincluding privacy concerns and the logistical difficulties of capturing diverse\nattack scenarios under controlled conditions. This work investigates the\napplication of Vision Language Models (VLM) and proposes an in-context learning\nframework for detecting physical presentation attacks and digital morphing\nattacks in biometric systems. Focusing on open-source models, the first\nsystematic framework for the quantitative evaluation of VLMs in\nsecurity-critical scenarios through in-context learning techniques is\nestablished. The experimental evaluation conducted on freely available\ndatabases demonstrates that the proposed subsystem achieves competitive\nperformance for physical and digital attack detection, outperforming some of\nthe traditional CNNs without resource-intensive training. The experimental\nresults validate the proposed framework as a promising tool for improving\ngeneralisation in attack detection.",

Additionally, developing generalist agents that\ncan adapt efficiently in real-world environments often requires leveraging\nthese reward-free signals to guide learning and behavior. However, while\nintrinsic motivation techniques provide a means for agents to seek out novel or\nuncertain states in the absence of explicit rewards, they are often challenged\nby dense reward environments or the complexity of high-dimensional state and\naction spaces. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely directly on the\nunprocessed intrinsic reward signals, which can make it difficult to shape or\ncontrol the agent's exploration effectively. We propose a framework that can\neffectively utilize expert demonstrations, even when they are incomplete and\nimperfect. By applying a mapping function to transform the similarity between\nan agent's state and expert data into a shaped intrinsic reward, our method\nallows for flexible and targeted exploration of expert-like behaviors.

      "abstract": "System identification methods for multivariate time-series, such as neural\nand behavioral recordings, have been used to build models for predicting one\nfrom the other. For example, Preferential Subspace Identification (PSID) builds\na state-space model of a primary time-series (e.g., neural activity) to\noptimally predict a secondary time-series (e.g., behavior). However, PSID\nfocuses on optimal prediction using past primary data, even though in offline\napplications, better estimation can be achieved by incorporating concurrent\ndata (filtering) or all available data (smoothing). Here, we extend PSID to\nenable optimal filtering and smoothing. First, we show that the presence of a\nsecondary signal makes it possible to uniquely identify a model with an optimal\nKalman update step (to enable filtering) from a family of otherwise equivalent\nstate-space models. Our filtering solution augments PSID with a reduced-rank\nregression step that directly learns the optimal gain required for the update\nstep from data. We refer to this extension of PSID as PSID with filtering.\nSecond, inspired by two-filter Kalman smoother formulations, we develop a novel\nforward-backward PSID smoothing algorithm where we first apply PSID with\nfiltering and then apply it again in the reverse time direction on the\nresiduals of the filtered secondary signal. We validate our methods on\nsimulated data, showing that our approach recovers the ground-truth model\nparameters for filtering, and achieves optimal filtering and smoothing decoding\nperformance of the secondary signal that matches the ideal performance of the\ntrue underlying model. This work provides a principled framework for optimal\nlinear filtering and smoothing in the two-signal setting, significantly\nexpanding the toolkit for analyzing dynamic interactions in multivariate\ntime-series.",

      "abstract": "Visualizing subtle vascular motions in endoscopic surgery is crucial for\nsurgical precision and decision-making, yet remains challenging due to the\ncomplex and dynamic nature of surgical scenes. To address this, we introduce\nEndoControlMag, a training-free, Lagrangian-based framework with\nmask-conditioned vascular motion magnification tailored to endoscopic\nenvironments. Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference\nResetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with\ndynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while\nmaintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification\n(HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores\nusing a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization\ndespite occlusions and view changes. It then applies one of two adaptive\nsoftening strategies to surrounding tissues: motion-based softening that\nmodulates magnification strength proportional to observed tissue displacement,\nor distance-based exponential decay that simulates biomechanical force\nattenuation. This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical\nscenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while\ndistance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow\nconditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four\ndifferent surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including\nocclusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations.\nQuantitative metrics, visual assessments, and expert surgeon evaluations\ndemonstrate that EndoControlMag significantly outperforms existing methods in\nboth magnification accuracy and visual quality while maintaining robustness\nacross challenging surgical conditions.

      "abstract": "Fingerprint matching under diverse capture conditions remains a fundamental\nchallenge in biometric recognition. To achieve robust and accurate performance\nin such scenarios, we propose DMD, a minutiae-anchored local dense\nrepresentation which captures both fine-grained ridge textures and\ndiscriminative minutiae features in a spatially structured manner.\nSpecifically, descriptors are extracted from local patches centered and\noriented on each detected minutia, forming a three-dimensional tensor, where\ntwo dimensions represent spatial locations on the fingerprint plane and the\nthird encodes semantic features. This representation explicitly captures\nabstract features of local image patches, enabling a multi-level, fine-grained\ndescription that aggregates information from multiple minutiae and their\nsurrounding ridge structures. Furthermore, thanks to its strong spatial\ncorrespondence with the patch image, DMD allows for the use of foreground\nsegmentation masks to identify valid descriptor regions. During matching,\ncomparisons are then restricted to overlapping foreground areas, improving\nefficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments on rolled, plain, parital,\ncontactless, and latent fingerprint datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and\ngeneralizability of the proposed method. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy\nacross multiple benchmarks while maintaining high computational efficiency,\nshowing strong potential for large-scale fingerprint recognition.

Specifically, this issue manifests in two aspects:\ni) channels with high weights may not necessarily be effective, and ii)\nchannels with low weights may still hold significant value. To handle this\nproblem, we consider utilizing the inter-channel correlation to facilitate the\nnovel model's adaptation process to novel conditions, ensuring the model can\ncorrectly highlight effective channels and rectify those incorrect ones. Since\nthe channel sequence is also 1-dimensional, its similarity with the temporal\nsequence inspires us to take Mamba for modeling the correlation in the channel\nsequence. Based on this concept, we propose a Spatial-Channel State Space\nModeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel state modeling, which highlights the\neffective patterns and rectifies those ineffective ones in feature channels. In\nSCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to balance the\nlearning of spatial relationships and channel relationships, and then introduce\nthe Channel State Modeling (CSM) module based on Mamba to learn correlation in\nchannels. Extensive experiments on the VOC and COCO datasets show that the SCSM\nmodule enables the novel detector to improve the quality of focused feature\nrepresentation in channels and achieve state-of-the-art performance.",

To overcome\ndata scarcity, we employ latent diffusion models with domain-specific textual\nconditioning, generating in-distribution synthetic defects that preserve\nindustrial context. Our neighborhood-aware ratio scoring mechanism elegantly\nfuses complementary distance metrics, amplifying signals in regions exhibiting\nboth deviation from normality and similarity to known defect patterns.\nExperimental validation on KSDD2 demonstrates superior performance (94.2%\nI-AUROC, 97.7% P-AUROC), with optimal augmentation at 100 synthetic samples.",

However, this static model\nselection practice overlooks the fine-grained, evolving relational dependencies\nbetween diverse task queries and model architecture variations, resulting in\nsuboptimal matches and failing to further refine the model effectively. To fill\nthe model refinement gap in database research, we propose M-DESIGN, a curated\nmodel knowledge base (MKB) pipeline for mastering neural network refinement by\nadaptively weaving prior insights about model architecture modification. First,\nwe propose a knowledge weaving engine that reframes model refinement as an\nadaptive query problem over task metadata. Given a user's task query, M-DESIGN\nquickly matches and iteratively refines candidate models by leveraging a\ngraph-relational knowledge schema that explicitly encodes data properties,\narchitecture variations, and pairwise performance deltas as joinable relations.\nThis schema supports fine-grained relational analytics over architecture tweaks\nand drives a predictive query planner that can detect and adapt to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. We instantiate M-DESIGN for graph analytics\ntasks, where our model knowledge base enriches existing benchmarks with\nstructured metadata covering 3 graph tasks and 22 graph datasets, contributing\ndata records of 67,760 graph models. Empirical results demonstrate that\nM-DESIGN delivers the optimal model in 26 of 33 data-task pairs within limited\nbudgets.",

One such intrinsic limitation is its inability to\neffectively capture the Chomsky hierarchy, such as regular expressions or\ndeterministic context-free grammars. Drawing inspiration from pushdown\nautomata, which efficiently resolve deterministic context-free grammars using\nstacks, we propose StackTrans to address the aforementioned issue within LLMs.\nUnlike previous approaches that modify the attention computation, StackTrans\nexplicitly incorporates hidden state stacks between Transformer layers. This\ndesign maintains compatibility with existing frameworks like flash-attention.\nSpecifically, our design features stack operations -- such as pushing and\npopping hidden states -- that are differentiable and can be learned in an\nend-to-end manner. Our comprehensive evaluation spans benchmarks for both\nChomsky hierarchies and large-scale natural languages. Across these diverse\ntasks, StackTrans consistently outperforms standard Transformer models and\nother baselines. We have successfully scaled StackTrans up from 360M to 7B\nparameters. In particular, our from-scratch pretrained model StackTrans-360M\noutperforms several larger open-source LLMs with 2-3x more parameters,\nshowcasing its superior efficiency and reasoning capability.",

      "abstract": "On-demand ride-sharing platforms face the fundamental challenge of\ndynamically bundling passengers with diverse origins and destinations and\nmatching them with vehicles in real time, all under significant uncertainty.\nRecently, MARL has emerged as a promising solution for this problem, leveraging\ndecentralized learning to address the curse of dimensionality caused by the\nlarge number of agents in the ride-hailing market and the resulting expansive\nstate and action spaces. However, conventional MARL-based ride-sharing\napproaches heavily rely on the accurate estimation of Q-values or V-values,\nwhich becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments.\nSpecifically, most of these approaches adopt an independent paradigm,\nexacerbating this issue, as each agent treats others as part of the\nenvironment, leading to unstable training and substantial estimation bias in\nvalue functions. To address these challenges, we propose two novel alternative\nmethods that bypass value function estimation. First, we adapt GRPO to\nride-sharing, replacing the PPO baseline with the group average reward to\neliminate critic estimation errors and reduce training bias. Second, inspired\nby GRPO's full utilization of group reward information, we customize the PPO\nframework for ride-sharing platforms and show that, under a homogeneous fleet,\nthe optimal policy can be trained using only one-step rewards - a method we\nterm One-Step Policy Optimization (OSPO). Experiments on a real-world Manhattan\nride-hailing dataset demonstrate that both GRPO and OSPO achieve superior\nperformance across most scenarios, efficiently optimizing pickup times and the\nnumber of served orders using simple MLP networks.",

Prior solutions based on\nsynthetic data augmentation or trajectory stitching often fail to generalize to\nnovel states and rely on heuristic stitching points. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Retrieval High-quAlity Demonstrations (RAD) for\ndecision-making, which combines non-parametric retrieval with diffusion-based\ngenerative modeling. RAD dynamically retrieves high-return states from the\noffline dataset as target states based on state similarity and return\nestimation, and plans toward them using a condition-guided diffusion model.\nSuch retrieval-guided generation enables flexible trajectory stitching and\nimproves generalization when encountered with underrepresented or\nout-of-distribution states. Extensive experiments confirm that RAD achieves\ncompetitive or superior performance compared to baselines across diverse\nbenchmarks, validating its effectiveness.",

The most effective models in\nthis domain have billions of parameters, thus requiring extremely large\ndatasets, expensive training regimes, and compute-intensive inference. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that it is possible to train models on much smaller but\nhigh-fidelity synthetic datasets, with no loss in accuracy and higher\nefficiency. Using synthetic training data provides us with excellent levels of\ndetail and perfect labels, while providing strong guarantees for data\nprovenance, usage rights, and user consent. Procedural data synthesis also\nprovides us with explicit control on data diversity, that we can use to address\nunfairness in the models we train. Extensive quantitative assessment on real\ninput images demonstrates accuracy of our models on three dense prediction\ntasks: depth estimation, surface normal estimation, and soft foreground\nsegmentation. Our models require only a fraction of the cost of training and\ninference when compared with foundational models of similar accuracy.

The achievable\nrate is simplified using the Arimoto-Blahut algorithm, and the problem is\nbroken into quadratic programs with quadratic constraints (QPQC) sub-problems\nusing an alternating optimization approach. To improve efficiency, we develop a\nmodel-based neural network optimization that utilizes the one-hot encoding for\nthe angles of incidence and reflection. We address practical RIS limitations by\nusing a greedy search algorithm to solve the optimization problem for discrete\nphase shifts. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods\neffectively shape the multi-beam radiation pattern towards desired directions\nwhile satisfying reradiation mask constraints.

However, traditional evaluation methods, which\nfocus solely on final accuracy, fail to capture the full dynamics of the\nlearning process. To address this gap, we propose PALM (Performance Analysis of\nActive Learning Models), a unified and interpretable mathematical model that\ncharacterizes AL trajectories through four key parameters: achievable accuracy,\ncoverage efficiency, early-stage performance, and scalability. PALM provides a\npredictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the\nestimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across\ndifferent strategies. We validate PALM through extensive experiments on\nCIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-50/100/200, covering a wide range of AL methods and\nself-supervised embeddings. Our results demonstrate that PALM generalizes\neffectively across datasets, budgets, and strategies, accurately predicting\nfull learning curves from limited labeled data. Importantly, PALM reveals\ncrucial insights into learning efficiency, data space coverage, and the\nscalability of AL methods. By enabling the selection of cost-effective\nstrategies and predicting performance under tight budget constraints, PALM lays\nthe basis for more systematic, reproducible, and data-efficient evaluation of\nAL in both research and real-world applications.

Their ever-evolving nature renders traditional\nrule-based and feature-engineered detectors ineffective in the ongoing arms\nrace between attackers and defenders. The rise of large language models (LLMs)\nfurther exacerbates the threat, enabling attackers to craft highly convincing\nphishing emails at minimal cost.\n  This work demonstrates that LLMs can generate psychologically persuasive\nphishing emails tailored to victim profiles, successfully bypassing nearly all\ncommercial and academic detectors. To defend against such threats, we propose\nPiMRef, the first reference-based phishing email detector that leverages\nknowledge-based invariants. Our core insight is that persuasive phishing emails\noften contain disprovable identity claims, which contradict real-world facts.\nPiMRef reframes phishing detection as an identity fact-checking task. Given an\nemail, PiMRef (i) extracts the sender's claimed identity, (ii) verifies the\nlegitimacy of the sender's domain against a predefined knowledge base, and\n(iii) detects call-to-action prompts that push user engagement. Contradictory\nclaims are flagged as phishing indicators and serve as human-understandable\nexplanations.\n  Compared to existing methods such as D-Fence, HelpHed, and ChatSpamDetector,\nPiMRef boosts precision by 8.8% with no loss in recall on standard benchmarks\nlike Nazario and PhishPot. In a real-world evaluation of 10,183 emails across\nfive university accounts over three years, PiMRef achieved 92.1% precision,\n87.9% recall, and a median runtime of 0.05s, outperforming the state-of-the-art\nin both effectiveness and efficiency.",

Especially when facial information is partially\noccluded, existing FER models struggle to extract effective facial features,\nleading to inaccurate classifications. In response, we present ORSANet, which\nintroduces the following three key contributions: First, we introduce auxiliary\nmulti-modal semantic guidance to disambiguate facial occlusion and learn\nhigh-level semantic knowledge, which is two-fold: 1) we introduce semantic\nsegmentation maps as dense semantics prior to generate semantics-enhanced\nfacial representations; 2) we introduce facial landmarks as sparse geometric\nprior to mitigate intrinsic noises in FER, such as identity and gender biases.\nSecond, to facilitate the effective incorporation of these two multi-modal\npriors, we customize a Multi-scale Cross-interaction Module (MCM) to adaptively\nfuse the landmark feature and semantics-enhanced representations within\ndifferent scales. Third, we design a Dynamic Adversarial Repulsion Enhancement\nLoss (DARELoss) that dynamically adjusts the margins of ambiguous classes,\nfurther enhancing the model's ability to distinguish similar expressions. We\nfurther construct the first occlusion-oriented FER dataset to facilitate\nspecialized robustness analysis on various real-world occlusion conditions,\ndubbed Occlu-FER. Extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and Occlu-FER\ndemonstrate that our proposed ORSANet achieves SOTA recognition performance.\nCode is publicly available at https://github.com/Wenyuzhy/ORSANet-master.",

Despite significant advancements in deep\nlearning-based surgical phase recognition, these models remain inherently\nopaque, making it difficult to understand how they make decisions. This lack of\ninterpretability hinders trust and makes it challenging to debug the model. To\naddress this challenge, we propose SurgX, a novel concept-based explanation\nframework that enhances the interpretability of surgical phase recognition\nmodels by associating neurons with relevant concepts. In this paper, we\nintroduce the process of selecting representative example sequences for\nneurons, constructing a concept set tailored to the surgical video dataset,\nassociating neurons with concepts and identifying neurons crucial for\npredictions. Through extensive experiments on two surgical phase recognition\nmodels, we validate our method and analyze the explanation for prediction.

As they serve as the primary visual\ninput for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient\nis therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in\nvision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities,\nbut their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video\ninputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person\nvideos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints\ninherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a\ntraining-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning.\nEgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR\nfor temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering\n(PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and\nremoves redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token\nselector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame\ndiversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune\nconsistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning\nratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover,\nwe deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB\nedge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for\non-device egomotion video reasoning.",

Very recent advances have enabled flight in such conditions, but\nthey either rely on constant motion through the pipe to mitigate airflow\nrecirculation effects or suffer from limited stability during hovering. In this\nwork, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for\nhovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We\ndevelop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates\nlocal airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a\ndisturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which\ninfers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances\nare integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement\nlearning. The flow-feedback control proves particularly effective during\nlateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time\ndisturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract\ntransient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe\nwall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first\ndemonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time\nflow field measurements. This opens new directions for research on flight in\naerodynamically complex environments. In addition, our work also sheds light on\nthe characteristic flow structures that emerge during flight in narrow,\ncircular pipes, providing new insights at the intersection of robotics and\nfluid dynamics.",

      "abstract": "We propose a mesh-free policy iteration framework that combines classical\ndynamic programming with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve\nhigh-dimensional, nonconvex Hamilton--Jacobi--Isaacs (HJI) equations arising in\nstochastic differential games and robust control. The method alternates between\nsolving linear second-order PDEs under fixed feedback policies and updating the\ncontrols via pointwise minimax optimization using automatic differentiation.\nUnder standard Lipschitz and uniform ellipticity assumptions, we prove that the\nvalue function iterates converge locally uniformly to the unique viscosity\nsolution of the HJI equation. The analysis establishes equi-Lipschitz\nregularity of the iterates, enabling provable stability and convergence without\nrequiring convexity of the Hamiltonian. Numerical experiments demonstrate the\naccuracy and scalability of the method. In a two-dimensional stochastic\npath-planning game with a moving obstacle, our method matches finite-difference\nbenchmarks with relative $L^2$-errors below %10^{-2}%. In five- and\nten-dimensional publisher-subscriber differential games with anisotropic noise,\nthe proposed approach consistently outperforms direct PINN solvers, yielding\nsmoother value functions and lower residuals. Our results suggest that\nintegrating PINNs with policy iteration is a practical and theoretically\ngrounded method for solving high-dimensional, nonconvex HJI equations, with\npotential applications in robotics, finance, and multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning.",

      "abstract": "In business processes, activity batching refers to packing multiple activity\ninstances for joint execution. Batching allows managers to trade off cost and\nprocessing effort against waiting time. Larger and less frequent batches may\nlower costs by reducing processing effort and amortizing fixed costs, but they\ncreate longer waiting times. In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches\nreduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching\npolicy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each\nbatch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching\npolicies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing\neffort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts\nfrom a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates\nalternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.\nEach heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching\npolicy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or\nresource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching\npolicy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via\nsimulation. The intervention heuristics are embedded in an optimization\nmeta-heuristic that triggers interventions to iteratively update the Pareto\nfront of the interventions identified so far. The paper considers three\nmeta-heuristics: hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and reinforcement\nlearning. An experimental evaluation compares the proposed approach based on\nintervention heuristics against the same (non-heuristic guided) meta-heuristics\nbaseline regarding convergence, diversity, and cycle time gain of\nPareto-optimal policies.",

This dichotomy has long\nmotivated research into specialized hardware to mitigate the MHA bottleneck.\n  This paper argues that recent architectural shifts, namely Multi-head Latent\nAttention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), challenge the premise of\nspecialized attention hardware. We make two key observations. First, the\narithmetic intensity of MLA is over two orders of magnitude greater than that\nof MHA, shifting it close to a compute-bound regime well-suited for modern\naccelerators like GPUs. Second, by distributing MoE experts across a pool of\naccelerators, their arithmetic intensity can be tuned through batching to match\nthat of the dense layers, creating a more balanced computational profile.\n  These findings reveal a diminishing need for specialized attention hardware.\nThe central challenge for next-generation Transformers is no longer\naccelerating a single memory-bound layer. Instead, the focus must shift to\ndesigning balanced systems with sufficient compute, memory capacity, memory\nbandwidth, and high-bandwidth interconnects to manage the diverse demands of\nlarge-scale models.",

Steel\nsurfaces not only have defects of various sizes and shapes, which limit the\naccuracy of traditional image processing and detection methods in complex\nenvironments. However, traditional defect detection methods face issues of\ninsufficient accuracy and high miss-detection rates when dealing with small\ntarget defects. To address this issue, this study proposes a detection\nframework based on deep learning, specifically YOLOv9s, combined with the\nC3Ghost module, SCConv module, and CARAFE upsampling operator, to improve\ndetection accuracy and model performance. First, the SCConv module is used to\nreduce feature redundancy and optimize feature representation by reconstructing\nthe spatial and channel dimensions. Second, the C3Ghost module is introduced to\nenhance the model's feature extraction ability by reducing redundant\ncomputations and parameter volume, thereby improving model efficiency. Finally,\nthe CARAFE upsampling operator, which can more finely reorganize feature maps\nin a content-aware manner, optimizes the upsampling process and ensures\ndetailed restoration of high-resolution defect regions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher accuracy and robustness in\nsteel surface defect detection tasks compared to other methods, effectively\naddressing defect detection problems.",

Our\nwork shows how neuro-symbolic systems, which integrate probabilistic, symbolic\nwhite-box reasoning models with deep learning methods, offer a powerful\nsolution to this challenge. This enables the simultaneous consideration of\nexplicit rules and neural models trained on noisy data, combining the strength\nof structured reasoning with flexible representations. To this end, we\nintroduce the Constitutional Controller (CoCo), a novel framework designed to\nenhance the safety and reliability of agents by reasoning over deep\nprobabilistic logic programs representing constraints such as those found in\nshared traffic spaces. Furthermore, we propose the concept of self-doubt,\nimplemented as a probability density conditioned on doubt features such as\ntravel velocity, employed sensors, or health factors. In a real-world aerial\nmobility study, we demonstrate CoCo's advantages for intelligent autonomous\nsystems to learn appropriate doubts and navigate complex and uncertain\nenvironments safely and compliantly.",

However, effectively integrating multi-sequence MRI data for\nrobust 3D lesion classification remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose\nDeSamba (Decoupled Spectral Adaptive Network and Mamba-Based Model), a novel\nframework designed to extract decoupled representations and adaptively fuse\nspatial and spectral features for lesion classification. DeSamba introduces a\nDecoupled Representation Learning Module (DRLM) that decouples features from\ndifferent MRI sequences through self-reconstruction and cross-reconstruction,\nand a Spectral Adaptive Modulation Block (SAMB) within the proposed SAMNet,\nenabling dynamic fusion of spectral and spatial information based on lesion\ncharacteristics. We evaluate DeSamba on two clinically relevant 3D datasets. On\na six-class spinal metastasis dataset (n=1,448), DeSamba achieves 62.10% Top-1\naccuracy, 63.62% F1-score, 87.71% AUC, and 93.55% Top-3 accuracy on an external\nvalidation set (n=372), outperforming all state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. On\na spondylitis dataset (n=251) involving a challenging binary classification\ntask, DeSamba achieves 70.00%/64.52% accuracy and 74.75/73.88 AUC on internal\nand external validation sets, respectively. Ablation studies demonstrate that\nboth DRLM and SAMB significantly contribute to overall performance, with over\n10% relative improvement compared to the baseline. Our results highlight the\npotential of DeSamba as a generalizable and effective solution for 3D lesion\nclassification in multi-sequence medical imaging.",

We design a prompt-aware frame sampling\nstrategy that dynamically guides lightweight feature extractors using textual\nprompts to select semantically relevant frames, overcoming the limitations of\nexisting salient-frame sampling methods which rely on static, query-agnostic\nselection criteria. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage candidate pruning strategy\nthat combines rapid coarse filtering via a lightweight module with CLIP-powered\nfine-grained re-ranking, enhancing retrieval efficiency while preserving\naccuracy. Experiments across benchmarks show ProCLIP achieves 75.3% latency\nreduction versus baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy, i.e.,\nR@1=49.0 in MSR-VTT dataset.

Through extensive real-world experiments, we show GR-3 surpasses the\nstate-of-the-art baseline method, $\\pi_0$, on a wide variety of challenging\ntasks. We hope GR-3 can serve as a step towards building generalist robots\ncapable of assisting humans in daily life.",

Although interactive systems\nhave emerged to address these challenges by refining user intent through\nclarifying questions, current methods typically rely on heuristic or ad-hoc\nstrategies without explicitly quantifying these uncertainties, limiting their\neffectiveness. Motivated by this gap, we propose UMIVR, an\nUncertainty-Minimizing Interactive Text-to-Video Retrieval framework that\nexplicitly quantifies three critical uncertainties-text ambiguity, mapping\nuncertainty, and frame uncertainty-via principled, training-free metrics:\nsemantic entropy-based Text Ambiguity Score (TAS), Jensen-Shannon\ndivergence-based Mapping Uncertainty Score (MUS), and a Temporal Quality-based\nFrame Sampler (TQFS). By adaptively generating targeted clarifying questions\nguided by these uncertainty measures, UMIVR iteratively refines user queries,\nsignificantly reducing retrieval ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple\nbenchmarks validate UMIVR's effectiveness, achieving notable gains in Recall@1\n(69.2\\% after 10 interactive rounds) on the MSR-VTT-1k dataset, thereby\nestablishing an uncertainty-minimizing foundation for interactive TVR.",

In RLHF for\nLMs, we first train an LM using supervised fine-tuning, sample pairs of\nresponses, obtain human feedback, and use the resulting data to train a reward\nmodel (RM). RL methods are then used to train the LM to maximize the reward\ngiven by the RM. As training progresses, the responses generated by the LM no\nlonger resemble the responses seen by the RM during training, leading to the RM\nbecoming inaccurate. The score given by the RM keeps increasing, but the\nlearned behavior no longer matches the human preferences. This issue is known\nas overoptimization. We investigate overoptimization from the point of view of\ndistribution shift and show that the shift results in an inconsistent estimate\nof the RM parameters, leading to an inconsistent estimate of the policy\ngradient. We propose Off-Policy Corrected Reward Modeling (OCRM), which\niteratively off-policy corrects the RM using importance weighting, without\nrequiring new labels or samples. This results in a more accurate RM, which\nempirically leads to an improved final policy.

Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning\nand code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their\nadvantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal\ndata type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in\ncomplex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain\nvision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex\nchart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic\ndata synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning\ndata covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of\nreasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training\nstrategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and\nChart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims\nto decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable\nsubtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for\nimproving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the\ntypical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft\nreward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity\nin the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks\nand self-built chart reasoning dataset (\\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}). Experimental\nresults show that Chart-R1 has significant advantages compared to chart-domain\nmethods, even comparable to open/closed source large-scale models (\\emph{e.g.,\nGPT-4o, Claude-3.5}).",

      "abstract": "Creating an immersive and interactive theatrical experience is a long-term\ngoal in the field of interactive narrative. The emergence of large language\nmodel (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing\nLLM-based drama generation methods often result in AI agents that lack\ninitiative and cannot interact with the physical environment. Furthermore,\nthese methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These\nlimitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time\nperformance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent\nframework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple\ntopic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent\nimprovisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given\nan autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based\non their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to\nconversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of\nscene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon.\nThe change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know\nand care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the\nquality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three\nprimary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and\ninteraction experience. The experimental evaluation shows that HAMLET can\ncreate expressive and coherent theatrical experiences. Our code, dataset and\nmodels are available at https://github.com/HAMLET-2025/HAMLET.",

Extensive experiments on five standard\nlow-light datasets and a cross-domain benchmark (LOL-Blur) demonstrate that our\nSAIGFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both\nquantitative and qualitative metrics.

We adapt cognitive science methodologies from\nhuman mental models research to test LLMs on pulley system problems using\nTikZ-rendered stimuli. Study 1 examines whether LLMs can estimate mechanical\nadvantage (MA). State-of-the-art models performed marginally but significantly\nabove chance, and their estimates correlated significantly with ground-truth\nMA. Significant correlations between number of pulleys and model estimates\nsuggest that models employed a pulley counting heuristic, without necessarily\nsimulating pulley systems to derive precise values. Study 2 tested this by\nprobing whether LLMs represent global features crucial to MA estimation. Models\nevaluated a functionally connected pulley system against a fake system with\nrandomly placed components. Without explicit cues, models identified the\nfunctional system as having greater MA with F1=0.8, suggesting LLMs could\nrepresent systems well enough to differentiate jumbled from functional systems.\nStudy 3 built on this by asking LLMs to compare functional systems with matched\nsystems which were connected up but which transferred no force to the weight;\nLLMs identified the functional system with F1=0.46, suggesting random guessing.\nInsofar as they may generalize, these findings are compatible with the notion\nthat LLMs manipulate internal world models, sufficient to exploit statistical\nassociations between pulley count and MA (Study 1), and to approximately\nrepresent system components' spatial relations (Study 2). However, they may\nlack the facility to reason over nuanced structural connectivity (Study 3).

To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a self-supervised procedure learning framework, which\nutilizes a fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport formulation with a\nstructural prior for computing frame-to-frame mapping between videos. However,\noptimizing exclusively for the above temporal alignment term may lead to\ndegenerate solutions, where all frames are mapped to a small cluster in the\nembedding space and hence every video is associated with only one key step. To\naddress that limitation, we further integrate a contrastive regularization\nterm, which maps different frames to different points in the embedding space,\navoiding the collapse to trivial solutions. Finally, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on large-scale egocentric (i.e., EgoProceL) and third-person (i.e.,\nProceL and CrossTask) benchmarks to demonstrate superior performance by our\napproach against previous methods, including OPEL which relies on a traditional\nKantorovich optimal transport formulation with an optimality prior.",

      "abstract": "Zero-shot human-object interaction (HOI) detection remains a challenging\ntask, particularly in generalizing to unseen actions. Existing methods address\nthis challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge\nbeyond the training data. However, they either struggle to distinguish actions\ninvolving the same object or demonstrate limited generalization to unseen\nclasses. In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with\nLow-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both\nenhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In\ntraining, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank\nfactorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.\nThese features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves\nshared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.\nSubsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI\nclass and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction\nrepresentations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight\nadaptation with LLM-derived action regularization. Experimental results show\nthat our method sets a new state-of-the-art across zero-shot HOI settings on\nHICO-DET, achieving an unseen-class mAP of 27.91 in the unseen-verb setting.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/ChelsieLei/HOLa.",

Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information\nseparately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately\nrepresent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to\ntemporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature\nextraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and\nvideo understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video\nrepresentation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce\na set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas\ncontaining fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature\nextraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the\nfine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to\nmaintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video\nRotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency\nof DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this\ncombined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the\nstate-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video\nunderstanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in\nenhancing video comprehension.",

This paper\nexplores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in optimizing the operation\nof satellite mega-constellations, drawing from the ConstellAI project funded by\nthe European Space Agency (ESA). A consortium comprising GMV GmbH, Saarland\nUniversity, and Thales Alenia Space collaborates to develop AI-driven\nalgorithms and demonstrates their effectiveness over traditional methods for\ntwo crucial operational challenges: data routing and resource allocation. In\nthe routing use case, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to improve the\nend-to-end latency by learning from historical queuing latency, outperforming\nclassical shortest path algorithms. For resource allocation, RL optimizes the\nscheduling of tasks across constellations, focussing on efficiently using\nlimited resources such as battery and memory. Both use cases were tested for\nmultiple satellite constellation configurations and operational scenarios,\nresembling the real-life spacecraft operations of communications and Earth\nobservation satellites. This research demonstrates that RL not only competes\nwith classical approaches but also offers enhanced flexibility, scalability,\nand generalizability in decision-making processes, which is crucial for the\nautonomous and intelligent management of satellite fleets.

We\npropose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a\nlearned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a\nStyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation,\nwe sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different\nclasses and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition\nthe generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that\nlie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale\nCOVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101,\nEfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1\nover traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for\nCOVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup,\ndelivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without\ndisrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at\nhttps://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further\nresearch.",

To overcome this limitation, we\npropose shifting the entire change detection workflow onboard satellites. This\nrequires to simultaneously solve challenges in data storage, image registration\nand change detection with a strict complexity constraint. In this paper, we\npresent a novel and efficient framework for onboard change detection that\naddresses the aforementioned challenges in an end-to-end fashion with a deep\nneural network composed of three interlinked submodules: (1) image compression,\ntailored to minimize onboard data storage resources; (2) lightweight\nco-registration of non-orthorectified multi-temporal image pairs; and (3) a\nnovel temporally-invariant and computationally efficient change detection\nmodel. This is the first approach in the literature combining all these tasks\nin a single end-to-end framework with the constraints dictated by onboard\nprocessing. Experimental results compare each submodule with the current\nstate-of-the-art, and evaluate the performance of the overall integrated system\nin realistic setting on low-power hardware. Compelling change detection results\nare obtained in terms of F1 score as a function of compression rate, sustaining\na throughput of 0.7 Mpixel/s on a 15W accelerator.",

Existing VLAs struggle with complex manipulation\ntasks requiring high dexterity and generalize poorly to novel scenarios and\ntasks, primarily due to their reliance on synthetic data with significant\nsim-to-real gaps or teleoperated demonstrations lacking scale and diversity. To\naddress this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation\nmanipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web\ndata. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training\nparadigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical\nspace alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic\ntasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which\nachieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand\ntrajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further\ndevelop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous\nsources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a\nlarge-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We\nempirically show the excellence of Being-H0 in hand motion generation and\ninstruction following, and it also scales well with model and data sizes.\nImportantly, we observe the expected gains of Being-H0 in real-world robotic\nmanipulation as physical instruction tuning is applied.

In this paper, we propose CylinderPlane, a novel implicit\nrepresentation based on Cylindrical Coordinate System, to eliminate the feature\nambiguity issue and ensure multi-view consistency in 360$^\\circ$. Different\nfrom the inevitable feature entanglement in Cartesian coordinate-based\nTri-plane representation, the cylindrical coordinate system explicitly\nseparates features at different angles, allowing our cylindrical representation\npossible to achieve high-quality, artifacts-free 360$^\\circ$ image synthesis.\nWe further introduce the nested cylinder representation that composites\nmultiple cylinders at different scales, thereby enabling the model more\nadaptable to complex geometry and varying resolutions. The combination of\ncylinders with different resolutions can effectively capture more critical\nlocations and multi-scale features, greatly facilitates fine detail learning\nand robustness to different resolutions. Moreover, our representation is\nagnostic to implicit rendering methods and can be easily integrated into any\nneural rendering pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetic dataset and\nunstructured in-the-wild images demonstrate that our proposed representation\nachieves superior performance over previous methods.",

One critical threat is\nprompt inference attacks: adversaries chain together seemingly benign prompts\nto gradually extract confidential data. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive study of multi-stage prompt inference attacks in an enterprise\nLLM context. We simulate realistic attack scenarios where an attacker uses\nmild-mannered queries and indirect prompt injections to exploit an LLM\nintegrated with private corporate data. We develop a formal threat model for\nthese multi-turn inference attacks and analyze them using probability theory,\noptimization frameworks, and information-theoretic leakage bounds. The attacks\nare shown to reliably exfiltrate sensitive information from the LLM's context\n(e.g., internal SharePoint documents or emails), even when standard safety\nmeasures are in place.\n  We propose and evaluate defenses to counter such attacks, including\nstatistical anomaly detection, fine-grained access control, prompt sanitization\ntechniques, and architectural modifications to LLM deployment. Each defense is\nsupported by mathematical analysis or experimental simulation. For example, we\nderive bounds on information leakage under differential privacy-based training\nand demonstrate an anomaly detection method that flags multi-turn attacks with\nhigh AUC. We also introduce an approach called \"spotlighting\" that uses input\ntransformations to isolate untrusted prompt content, reducing attack success by\nan order of magnitude. Finally, we provide a formal proof of concept and\nempirical validation for a combined defense-in-depth strategy. Our work\nhighlights that securing LLMs in enterprise settings requires moving beyond\nsingle-turn prompt filtering toward a holistic, multi-stage perspective on both\nattacks and defenses.",

The central challenge is to accelerate these simulations without\nsacrificing accuracy. This paper introduces a deep learning surrogate that\ntreats HEC-RAS not as a solver but as a data-generation engine. We propose a\nhybrid, auto-regressive architecture that combines a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\nto capture short-term temporal dynamics with a Geometry-Aware Fourier Neural\nOperator (Geo-FNO) to model long-range spatial dependencies along a river\nreach. The model learns underlying physics implicitly from a minimal\neight-channel feature vector encoding dynamic state, static geometry, and\nboundary forcings extracted directly from native HEC-RAS files. Trained on 67\nreaches of the Mississippi River Basin, the surrogate was evaluated on a\nyear-long, unseen hold-out simulation. Results show the model achieves a strong\npredictive accuracy, with a median absolute stage error of 0.31 feet.\nCritically, for a full 67-reach ensemble forecast, our surrogate reduces the\nrequired wall-clock time from 139 minutes to 40 minutes, a speedup of nearly\n3.5 times over the traditional solver. The success of this data-driven approach\ndemonstrates that robust feature engineering can produce a viable, high-speed\nreplacement for conventional hydraulic models, improving the computational\nfeasibility of large-scale ensemble flood forecasting.",

We organize existing\nmethods in a bottom-up manner, covering multiple perspectives such as hardware\nsupport, data processing, operational deployment, etc. Finally, based on the\noptimization framework and existing works, we analyze and discuss the problems\nand challenges in the performance optimization of DNN-based video analytics.",

      "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown its detailed expressive ability and\nhighly efficient rendering speed in the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. The\napplication to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the\ndiscrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry\nconstraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us\nto link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity\ntransformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the\ncomputational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the\ndiscrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete\nrepresentation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal\nloss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and\nenforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based\nconsistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher\nrelighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding\ncomplex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method\noutperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods. Our code is\navailable at https://github.com/NK-CS-ZZL/DiscretizedSDF.",

While current detection methods show promise, their underlying\nmechanisms remain poorly understood, and the large sizes of their models make\nthem challenging to deploy in resource-limited environments. This study\ninvestigates the application of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to deepfake\ndetection, aiming to identify the key features crucial for recognizing\ndeepfakes. We examine how neural networks can be efficiently pruned while\nmaintaining high detection accuracy. Through extensive experiments with\nMesoNet, CNN-5, and ResNet-18 architectures on the OpenForensic and\nFaceForensics++ datasets, we find that deepfake detection networks contain\nwinning tickets, i.e., subnetworks, that preserve performance even at\nsubstantial sparsity levels. Our results indicate that MesoNet retains 56.2%\naccuracy at 80% sparsity on the OpenForensic dataset, with only 3,000\nparameters, which is about 90% of its baseline accuracy (62.6%). The results\nalso show that our proposed LTH-based iterative magnitude pruning approach\nconsistently outperforms one-shot pruning methods. Using Grad-CAM\nvisualization, we analyze how pruned networks maintain their focus on critical\nfacial regions for deepfake detection.

Previous domain reweighting strategies\nrely on manual designation with certain heuristics based on human intuition or\nempirical results. In this work, we prove that more general heuristics can be\nparameterized by proposing Data Mixing Agent, the first model-based, end-to-end\nframework that learns to re-weight domains. The agent learns generalizable\nheuristics through reinforcement learning on large quantities of data mixing\ntrajectories with corresponding feedback from an evaluation environment.\nExperiments in continual pre-training on math reasoning show that Data Mixing\nAgent outperforms strong baselines in achieving balanced performance across\nsource and target field benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes well across\nunseen source fields, target models, and domain spaces without retraining.\nDirect application to the code generation field also indicates its adaptability\nacross target domains. Further analysis showcases the agents' well-aligned\nheuristics with human intuitions and their efficiency in achieving superior\nmodel performance with less source-field data.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides by\ncombining visual recognition and language understanding to generate content\nthat is both coherent and contextually accurate. However, MLLMs continue to\nstruggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible\nbut factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the\nimage. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly\nsuppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs.\nHowever, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer\nstage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and\nthe differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability\ndistributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers.\nMotivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a\nsimple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with\nthe most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output\ndistributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and\npure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally\nincorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly,\nEVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding\nstrategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on\nwidely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces\nhallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its\neffectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.",

Among these models, Stable Diffusion (SD) - an open-source\ntext-to-image generation model - has become the most popular, producing over 12\nbillion images annually. However, the widespread use of these models raises\nconcerns regarding their social and environmental sustainability.\n  Aims: To reduce the harm that SD models may have on society and the\nenvironment, we introduce SustainDiffusion, a search-based approach designed to\nenhance the social and environmental sustainability of SD models.\n  Method: SustainDiffusion searches the optimal combination of hyperparameters\nand prompt structures that can reduce gender and ethnic bias in generated\nimages while also lowering the energy consumption required for image\ngeneration. Importantly, SustainDiffusion maintains image quality comparable to\nthat of the original SD model.\n  Results: We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of SustainDiffusion,\ntesting it against six different baselines using 56 different prompts. Our\nresults demonstrate that SustainDiffusion can reduce gender bias in SD3 by 68%,\nethnic bias by 59%, and energy consumption (calculated as the sum of CPU and\nGPU energy) by 48%. Additionally, the outcomes produced by SustainDiffusion are\nconsistent across multiple runs and can be generalised to various prompts.\n  Conclusions: With SustainDiffusion, we demonstrate how enhancing the social\nand environmental sustainability of text-to-image generation models is possible\nwithout fine-tuning or changing the model's architecture.",

      "abstract": "Visual relocalization, which estimates the 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) camera\npose from query images, is fundamental to remote sensing and UAV applications.\nExisting methods face inherent trade-offs: image-based retrieval and pose\nregression approaches lack precision, while structure-based methods that\nregister queries to Structure-from-Motion (SfM) models suffer from\ncomputational complexity and limited scalability. These challenges are\nparticularly pronounced in remote sensing scenarios due to large-scale scenes,\nhigh altitude variations, and domain gaps of existing visual priors. To\novercome these limitations, we leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a novel\nscene representation that compactly encodes both 3D geometry and appearance. We\nintroduce $\\mathrm{Hi}^2$-GSLoc, a dual-hierarchical relocalization framework\nthat follows a sparse-to-dense and coarse-to-fine paradigm, fully exploiting\nthe rich semantic information and geometric constraints inherent in Gaussian\nprimitives. To handle large-scale remote sensing scenarios, we incorporate\npartitioned Gaussian training, GPU-accelerated parallel matching, and dynamic\nmemory management strategies. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a sparse\nstage featuring a Gaussian-specific consistent render-aware sampling strategy\nand landmark-guided detector for robust and accurate initial pose estimation,\nand (2) a dense stage that iteratively refines poses through coarse-to-fine\ndense rasterization matching while incorporating reliability verification.\nThrough comprehensive evaluation on simulation data, public datasets, and real\nflight experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers competitive\nlocalization accuracy, recall rate, and computational efficiency while\neffectively filtering unreliable pose estimates. The results confirm the\neffectiveness of our approach for practical remote sensing applications.",

      "abstract": "Existing AI-based point cloud compression methods struggle with dependence on\nspecific training data distributions, which limits their real-world deployment.\nImplicit Neural Representation (INR) methods solve the above problem by\nencoding overfitted network parameters to the bitstream, resulting in more\ndistribution-agnostic results. However, due to the limitation of encoding time\nand decoder size, current INR based methods only consider lossy geometry\ncompression. In this paper, we propose the first INR based lossless point cloud\ngeometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for\nPoint Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we\ndesign a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network\ninitialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time. A\nlightweight coding network based on multiscale SparseConv, consisting of scale\ncontext extraction, child node prediction, and model compression modules, is\nproposed to realize fast inference and compact decoder size. Experimental\nresults show that our method consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based\nmethods: for example, with the convergence time in the MVUB dataset, our method\nreduces the bitstream by approximately 21.21% compared to G-PCC TMC13v23 and\n21.95% compared to SparsePCGC.

Although FIQA has been extensively studied and achieved\nsignificant progress, the computational complexity of FIQA algorithms remains a\nkey concern for ensuring scalability and practical deployment in real-world\nsystems. In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA\nmethod that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically,\nour method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and\ndistilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher\nmodel, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first\ntrain the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate\npseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are\nused in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to\ncombine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model\nthrough self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further\npseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.\nThe student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,\npseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled\nimages from the enhanced teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model with an\nextremely low computational overhead. Moreover, our method achieved first place\nin the ICCV 2025 VQualA FIQA Challenge. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/sunwei925/Efficient-FIQA.git.",

The methodology involves iteratively generating pseudo-labels to enhance the teacher and provide comprehensive supervision for the student, resulting in the student model achieving performance comparable to the teacher while using 99% fewer parameters and nearly 100x lower computational operations, as validated by experimental results and a first-place win in the ICCV 2025 VQualA FIQA Challenge.",

We introduce\nBELO (BEnchmarking LLMs for Ophthalmology), a standardized and comprehensive\nevaluation benchmark developed through multiple rounds of expert checking by 13\nophthalmologists. BELO assesses ophthalmology-related clinical accuracy and\nreasoning quality. Using keyword matching and a fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, we\ncurated ophthalmology-specific multiple-choice-questions (MCQs) from diverse\nmedical datasets (BCSC, MedMCQA, MedQA, BioASQ, and PubMedQA). The dataset\nunderwent multiple rounds of expert checking. Duplicate and substandard\nquestions were systematically removed. Ten ophthalmologists refined the\nexplanations of each MCQ's correct answer. This was further adjudicated by\nthree senior ophthalmologists. To illustrate BELO's utility, we evaluated six\nLLMs (OpenAI o1, o3-mini, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-3-8B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro)\nusing accuracy, macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, BERTScore,\nBARTScore, METEOR, and AlignScore). In a further evaluation involving human\nexperts, two ophthalmologists qualitatively reviewed 50 randomly selected\noutputs for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and completeness. BELO consists of 900\nhigh-quality, expert-reviewed questions aggregated from five sources: BCSC\n(260), BioASQ (10), MedMCQA (572), MedQA (40), and PubMedQA (18). A public\nleaderboard has been established to promote transparent evaluation and\nreporting. Importantly, the BELO dataset will remain a hold-out,\nevaluation-only benchmark to ensure fair and reproducible comparisons of future\nmodels.",

Although this task\nhas seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing\nstronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific\ncomparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation\nparadigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to\nperformance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches\nbecome lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways\nacross generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop\ntransformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the\nliterature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on\nImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models.\nFirst, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and\nperformant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously\nunderexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending\nclassifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a\nstrong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the\nmotivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate\n\"forgetting\" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream\ndata, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control\nconsistency.

      "abstract": "Generating consistent long videos is a complex challenge: while\ndiffusion-based generative models generate visually impressive short clips,\nextending them to longer durations often leads to memory bottlenecks and\nlong-term inconsistency. In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage\nframework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method\ndecomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic\ncontrol, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth\ntransition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion\nmodel guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses\nshort clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To\n(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens\nat once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,\nan adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,\nreducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal\nand content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By\nleveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method\nprovides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new\npossibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive\nsimulations.

However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that\nproviding individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated\nactivity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee\nother team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or\nphysician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework\nfor effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence\nExplorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent\nsystem that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from\nindividualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an\noverseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The\nPCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision.\nThis effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen\nasynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical\nExamination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we\ncompared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across\n60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality\nintake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the\noverseeing PCP to review. This resulted in higher quality composite decisions.\nPCP oversight of g-AMIE was also more time-efficient than standalone PCP\nconsultations in prior work. While our study does not replicate existing\nclinical practices and likely underestimates clinicians' capabilities, our\nresults demonstrate the promise of asynchronous oversight as a feasible\nparadigm for diagnostic AI systems to operate under expert human oversight for\nenhancing real-world care.",

To address this gap, we present GasAgent,\nthe first multi-agent system for smart contract Gas optimization that combines\ncompatibility with existing patterns and automated discovery/validation of new\npatterns, enabling end-to-end optimization. GasAgent consists of four\nspecialized agents, Seeker, Innovator, Executor, and Manager, that collaborate\nin a closed loop to identify, validate, and apply Gas-saving improvements.\nExperiments on 100 verified real-world contracts demonstrate that GasAgent\nsuccessfully optimizes 82 contracts, achieving an average deployment Gas\nsavings of 9.97%. In addition, our evaluation confirms its compatibility with\nexisting tools and validates the effectiveness of each module through ablation\nstudies.

Although existing methods\nachieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance\ndegradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and\nindividual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and\ndesign two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and\nmitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the\nTime-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal\nconsistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,\nimproving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,\nbased on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an\nadaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is\nintroduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,\nenabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive\nexperiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF\nsignificantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method\nachieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall\n(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced\nscenarios.

The intricate interactions among\nintelligent agents make abnormal emergence analysis challenging, as traditional\ncausal methods focus on individual trajectories. Large language models offer\nnew possibilities for Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nreasoning to reveal agent intentions. However, existing approaches remain\nlimited to microscopic and static analysis. This paper introduces a framework:\nEmergence Analysis based on Multi-Agent Intention (EAMI), which enables dynamic\nand interpretable emergence analysis. EAMI first employs a dual-perspective\nthought track mechanism, where an Inspector Agent and an Analysis Agent extract\nagent intentions under bounded and perfect rationality. Then, k-means\nclustering identifies phase transition points in group intentions, followed by\na Intention Temporal Emergence diagram for dynamic analysis. The experiments\nvalidate EAMI in complex online-to-offline (O2O) service system and the\nStanford AI Town experiment, with ablation studies confirming its\neffectiveness, generalizability, and efficiency. This framework provides a\nnovel paradigm for abnormal emergence and causal analysis in service\necosystems. The code is available at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/EAMI-B085.",

However, traditional Raman analysis relies on customized\ndata-processing workflows that require fluorescence background removal and\nprior identification of Raman peaks of interest-introducing potential biases\nand inconsistencies.

Unlike conventional approaches,\nDIVA processes native Raman spectra-including fluorescence backgrounds-without\nmanual preprocessing, identifying and quantifying significant spectral features\nin an unbiased manner. We applied DIVA to detect a range of plant stresses,\nincluding abiotic (shading, high light intensity, high temperature) and biotic\nstressors (bacterial infections).

The methodology involves\ntraining neural networks to fit the spacetime around black holes and then\nemploying these trained models to generate the path of light rays affected by\ngravitational lensing. This enables efficient and scalable simulations of black\nholes with optically thin accretion disks, significantly decreasing the time\nrequired for rendering compared to traditional methods. We validate our\napproach through extensive rendering of multiple black hole systems with\nsuperposed Kerr metric, demonstrating its capability to produce accurate\nvisualizations with significantly $15\\times$ reduced computational time. Our\nfindings suggest that neural networks offer a promising alternative for\nrendering complex astrophysical phenomena, potentially paving a new path to\nastronomical visualization.",

We\nconduct a systematic evaluation by training models on various combinations of\nprominent ToM datasets (HiToM, ExploreToM, FANToM) and testing for\ngeneralization on held-out datasets (e.g., OpenToM). Our findings indicate that\nsmall LLMs struggle to develop a generic ToM capability. While performance on\nin-distribution tasks improves, this capability fails to transfer to unseen ToM\ntasks with different characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nprolonged RL training leads to models ``hacking'' the statistical patterns of\nthe training datasets, resulting in significant performance gains on in-domain\ndata but no change, or degradation of performance on out-of-distribution tasks.\nThis suggests the learned behavior is a form of narrow overfitting rather than\nthe acquisition of a true, abstract ToM capability.",

Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nis a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently\noccurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its\nimplementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be\nchallenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each\nmedical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image\nprocessing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that\ndynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation. Viewing the low-rank\nrepresentation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value\ndecomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function,\nand tackle it with a proximal optimizer. The regularizer could be viewed as a\npenalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find\ntask-adapted ranks automatically. Our method is evaluated in a realistic\nfew-shot fine-tuning setting, where we compare it first to the standard LoRA\nand then to several other PEFT methods across two distinguishable tasks: base\norgans and novel organs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant\nperformance improvements driven by our method, highlighting its efficiency and\nrobustness against suboptimal rank initialization.

      "abstract": "Pixel-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, require extensive\nand high-quality annotated data, which is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised\nsemantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the\nlabeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through\nself-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation\nmodels pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize\nacross domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational\nsegmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as\nan annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of\nusing SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual\ninput, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the\nshortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose\nConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation\nmodel using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable\npixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as\nsupervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models\nto target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the\nstrong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which\nbenefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training\nstrategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training\nstage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS,\nConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and\nhelps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.",

Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language\ndatasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the\ndemonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on\ntextual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal\nadaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its\npractical utility.

As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably\nevaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored.

Does this expectation materialize in\npractice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually\nwork? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to\ncomplement their own skills?\n  To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a\nprogram-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of\nproposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly\nassigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without,\nboth validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied\non a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric\napproach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and\nmeasurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a\nlimited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper\nrole for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs.\n  These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the\nuse of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed\nmethodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other\nprojects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible\nby the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs,\nwith 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs\nfor debugging and Automatic Program Repair.",

This indirect\nstrategy circumvents common hallucination issues in direct video-based\nevaluation.

In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive,\nuniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how\nincorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance both\nefficiency and performance. We build on recent advances in foveated image\nprocessing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both\nhuman head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA\nrobot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously\ncollecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as\nwell as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that\nincorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nin robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated\npatch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation.\nCompared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number\nof tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions\nof interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction\nfrom human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide\nfoveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space,\nallowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results\nshow that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces\ncomputational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks\nand robustness to unseen distractors. Together, these findings suggest that\nhuman-inspired visual processing offers a useful inductive bias for robotic\nvision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/",

      "abstract": "Large reasoning models achieve remarkable performance through extensive\nchain-of-thought generation, yet they suffer from a critical inefficiency:\napplying uniformly extensive reasoning regardless of problem complexity. We\npresent Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization (HBPO), a reinforcement\nlearning framework that enables models to learn problem-specific reasoning\ndepths without sacrificing capability. Unlike existing approaches that impose\nrigid constraints or rely on discrete mode selection, HBPO partitions the\nexploration space into budget-constrained hierarchies (512-2560 tokens), each\nwith differentiated reward structures that preserve both efficiency incentives\nand reasoning capabilities. This design addresses a fundamental challenge in\nefficient reasoning training: traditional length penalties systematically bias\nmodels away from necessary long reasoning paths, causing exploration space\ncollapse. Through hierarchical sampling and budget-aware rewards, HBPO\nmaintains exploration diversity while teaching models to recognize when\nextended deliberation is warranted. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HBPO\nreduces average token usage by up to 60.6% while improving accuracy by 3.14%\nacross four reasoning benchmarks. Most notably, HBPO exhibits emergent adaptive\nbehavior where models automatically adjust reasoning depth based on problem\ncomplexity. Our results suggest that reasoning efficiency and capability are\nnot inherently conflicting, and can be simultaneously optimized through\nappropriately structured hierarchical training that preserves exploration\ndiversity.",

Current\nreinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as\nhit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature\nof spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally\nforms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI\nGaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that\nmodels GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface\nplane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point\nrewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions\ncentered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment\nby measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target\nregions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance\nmechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions.\nThis framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to\ndense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich\ngradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions.\nExtensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro\nbenchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms\nstate-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of\n24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro.

This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on\ntemporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find\nthat larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference\npoint and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance\nlogarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To\nuncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses\nacross neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify\na set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits\nminimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a\nlogarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing\nrepresentations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where\nyears evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal\norientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we\nfound that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear\ntemporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal\nconstruction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for\nunderstanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a\nsubjective construction of the external world by its internal representational\nsystem. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien\ncognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a\ndirection for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions.

      "abstract": "Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a core task in computer vision, requiring\nmodels to track and segment target objects across video frames. Despite notable\nadvances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human\ncapabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex\nscene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a\ncomprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,\nrealizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively\nbalances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,\ndynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160\nmanually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with\nsubstantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In\nparticular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS,\nestablishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.",

We observe that\nmodern generative models share a conceptually similar training objective --\nreconstructing clean signals from corrupted inputs such as Gaussian noise or\nmasking -- a process we term denoising. Motivated by this insight, we propose\naligning tokenizer embeddings directly with the downstream denoising objective,\nencouraging latent embeddings to be more easily reconstructed even when heavily\ncorrupted. To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer\n(l-DeTok), a simple yet effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images\nfrom latent embeddings corrupted by interpolative noise and random masking.\nExtensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that our tokenizer\nconsistently outperforms standard tokenizers across six representative\ngenerative models. Our findings highlight denoising as a fundamental design\nprinciple for tokenizer development, and we hope it could motivate new\nperspectives for future tokenizer design.",

In this paper, we\nsystematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where\ntraining involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they\nsignificantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce.\nDiffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation\nloss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as\nimplicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse\ndistribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed\nleft-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and\nderive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which\ndiffusion begins to outperform AR.

This reliance on a\nmulti-step process originates from the factorization approximation of DFMs,\nwhich is necessary for handling high-dimensional data. In this paper, we\nrigorously characterize the approximation error from factorization using\nConditional Total Correlation (TC), which depends on the coupling. To reduce\nthe Conditional TC and enable efficient few-step generation, we propose\nRectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), a novel iterative method that reduces\nfactorization error by rectifying the coupling between source and target\ndistributions. We theoretically prove that each ReDi step guarantees a\nmonotonic decreasing Conditional TC, ensuring its convergence. Empirically,\nReDi significantly reduces Conditional TC and enables few-step generation.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that the rectified couplings are well-suited for\ntraining efficient one-step models on image generation. ReDi offers a simple\nand theoretically grounded approach for tackling the few-step challenge,\nproviding a new perspective on efficient discrete data synthesis.

By encoding each galaxy image into\na low-dimensional latent representation conditioned on key parameters, our\nmodel effectively recovers these morphological features in a disentangled\nmanner, while also reconstructing the original image.

However, optimizing policies with respect to a single\nreward model estimate can render it vulnerable to inaccuracies in the reward\nmodel. We empirically study the variability of reward model training on\nopen-source benchmarks. We observe that independently trained reward models on\nthe same preference dataset can exhibit substantial disagreement, highlighting\nthe instability of current alignment strategies. Employing a theoretical model,\nwe demonstrate that variability in reward model estimation can cause\noverfitting, leading to the risk of performance degradation. To mitigate this\nrisk, we propose a variance-aware policy optimization framework for\npreference-based alignment. The key ingredient of the framework is a new policy\nregularizer that incorporates reward model variance estimates. We show that\nvariance-aware policy optimization provably reduces the risk of outputting a\nworse policy than the default. Experiments across diverse LLM and reward model\nconfigurations confirm that our approach yields more stable and robust\nalignment than the standard (variance-unaware) pipeline.",

We review historical precedents, from\ninverted and meta-Turing variants to modern supervised reverse-Turing\nclassifiers, and highlight the novelty of combining quality thresholds, phased\ndifficulty levels, and minimax bounds. We then formalize the dual test: define\nthe judge's task over N independent rounds with fresh prompts drawn from a\nprompt space Q, introduce a quality function Q and parameters tau and delta,\nand cast the interaction as a two-player zero-sum game over the adversary's\nfeasible strategy set M. Next, we map this minimax game onto an RL-HF style\nalignment loop, in which an undetectability detector D provides negative reward\nfor stealthy outputs, balanced by a quality proxy that preserves fluency.\nThroughout, we include detailed explanations of each component notation, the\nmeaning of inner minimization over sequences, phased tests, and iterative\nadversarial training and conclude with a suggestion for a couple of immediate\nactions.",

To further optimize the performance, we\nintroduce an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy, which can dynamically adjust\nthe weights for critical category pairs using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and\nExponential Rank Decay (ERD). Specifically, IRW assigns weights inversely\nproportional to the rank differences between pairs, while ERD adaptively\ncontrols weight decay based on total ranking scores of category pairs.\nFurthermore, after the recursive decoupling, we distill the remaining\nnon-target knowledge to ensure knowledge completeness and enhance performance.\nUltimately, our method improves the student's performance by transferring\nfine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical relationships.\nExtensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and\nTiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method compares favorably with\nstate-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches.

Artificial intelligence (AI), especially Deep Learning (DL), has a\nstrong tool for medical image analysis; however, pre-trained models like CNNs\nand XAI techniques for mpox detection is underexplored. Objective: This study\naims to evaluate the effectiveness of pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19,\nInceptionV3, MobileNetV2) for the early detection of monkeypox using binary and\nmulti-class datasets. It also seeks to enhance model interpretability using\nGrad-CAM an XAI technique. Method: Two datasets, MSLD and MSLD v2.0, were used\nfor training and validation. Transfer learning techniques were applied to\nfine-tune pre-trained CNN models by freezing initial layers and adding custom\nlayers for adapting the final features for mpox detection task and avoid\noverfitting. Models performance were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy,\nprecision, recall, F1-score and ROC. Grad-CAM was utilized for visualizing\ncritical features. Results: InceptionV3 demonstrated the best performance on\nthe binary dataset with an accuracy of 95%, while MobileNetV2 outperformed on\nthe multi-class dataset with an accuracy of 93%. Grad-CAM successfully\nhighlighted key image regions. Despite high accuracy, some models showed\noverfitting tendencies, as videnced by discrepancies between training and\nvalidation losses. Conclusion: This study underscores the potential of\npre-trained CNN models in monkeypox detection and the value of XAI techniques.\nFuture work should address dataset limitations, incorporate multimodal data,\nand explore additional interpretability techniques to improve diagnostic\nreliability and model transparency",

      "abstract": "Face image quality plays a critical role in determining the accuracy and\nreliability of face verification systems, particularly in real-time screening\napplications such as surveillance, identity verification, and access control.\nLow-quality face images, often caused by factors such as motion blur, poor\nlighting conditions, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, significantly\ndegrade the performance of face recognition models, leading to higher false\nrejection and false acceptance rates. In this work, we propose a lightweight\nyet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to\npre-filter low-quality face images before they are passed to the verification\npipeline. Our approach utilises normalised facial landmarks in conjunction with\na Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an\naccuracy of 96.67%. By integrating this quality assessment module into the face\nverification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance,\nincluding a comfortable 99.7% reduction in the false rejection rate and\nenhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face\nverification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on\na real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV\nfootage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of\npoor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment\ntechniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, the framework\nspecifically addresses two critical challenges in real-time screening:\nvariations in face resolution and pose deviations, both of which are prevalent\nin practical surveillance scenarios.",

More importantly, we reveal and critically\nexamine an implicit assumption in prior work: intermediate reasoning steps are\nhidden from adversaries. By relaxing this assumption, we identify an important\nsecurity risk, intuitively motivated and empirically verified as an inverse\nscaling law: if intermediate reasoning steps become explicitly accessible,\nincreased inference-time computation consistently reduces model robustness.\nFinally, we discuss practical scenarios where models with hidden reasoning\nchains are still vulnerable to attacks, such as models with tool-integrated\nreasoning and advanced reasoning extraction attacks. Our findings collectively\ndemonstrate that the robustness benefits of inference-time scaling depend\nheavily on the adversarial setting and deployment context.

Given an image, we first dream plausible multi-views using a\nvideo diffusion model, capturing rich geometric and appearance details. These\nviews are then lifted into unstructured 3D Gaussians. To enable animation, we\npropose a transformer-based encoder that models global spatial relationships\nand projects these Gaussians into a structured latent representation aligned\nwith the UV space of a parametric body model. This latent code is decoded into\nUV-space Gaussians that can be animated via body-driven deformation and\nrendered conditioned on pose and viewpoint. By anchoring Gaussians to the UV\nmanifold, our method ensures consistency during animation while preserving fine\nvisual details. DLA enables real-time rendering and intuitive editing without\nrequiring post-processing. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches\non ActorsHQ and 4D-Dress datasets in both perceptual quality and photometric\naccuracy.

Our investigation shows that the mentioned language models (LMs)\nwith Retrieval Augmentation (RA) outperform baseline methods that don't\nincorporate RA in most cases. The macro F1 scores for MuRIL and XLM-R are 0.69\nand 0.495, respectively, without RA and increase to 0.70 and 0.71,\nrespectively, in the presence of RA. Fine-tuned Llama2-7B outperforms Llama2-7B\nby a significant margin. On the other hand the generative models which are not\nfine-tuned also perform better with augmented data. GPT3.5-turbo adopted RA\nwell; however, Llama2-70B and llama3-70B did not adopt RA with our retrieval\ncontext. The findings show that RA significantly improves performance,\nespecially for low-context data. This study adds significant knowledge about\nhow best to use data augmentation methods and pretrained models to enhance NER\nperformance, particularly in languages with limited resources.",

In a case study targeting a lightweight, high-strength\nalloy, AutoMAT identifies a titanium alloy with 8.1% lower density and\ncomparable yield strength relative to the state-of-the-art reference, achieving\nthe highest specific strength among all comparisons. In a second case targeting\nhigh-yield-strength high-entropy alloys, AutoMAT achieves a 28.2% improvement\nin yield strength over the base alloy. In both cases, AutoMAT reduces the\ndiscovery timeline from years to weeks, illustrating its potential as a\nscalable and versatile platform for next-generation alloy design.",

In contrast, this\npaper introduces a novel approach to the person-to-person try-on task. Unlike\nthe garment-to-person try-on task, the person-to-person task only involves two\ninput images: one depicting the target person and the other showing the garment\nworn by a different individual. The goal is to generate a realistic combination\nof the target person with the desired garment. To this end, we propose\nFlattening-and-Warping Virtual Try-On (\\textbf{FW-VTON}), a method that\noperates in three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the\nsource image; (2) warping the garment to align with the target pose; and (3)\nintegrating the warped garment seamlessly onto the target person. To overcome\nthe challenges posed by the lack of high-quality datasets for this task, we\nintroduce a new dataset specifically designed for person-to-person try-on\nscenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FW-VTON achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, with superior results in both qualitative and\nquantitative assessments, and also excels in garment extraction subtasks.",

However,\nthese claims are based on evaluations conducted across significantly different\nscenarios. Many of the challenging characteristics attributed to egocentric\nvision are also present in third person videos of human-object activities. This\nraises a critical question: how much of the observed performance drop stems\nfrom the unique first person viewpoint inherent to egocentric vision versus the\ndomain of human-object activities? To address this question, we introduce a new\nbenchmark study designed to disentangle such factors. Our evaluation strategy\nenables a more precise separation of challenges related to the first person\nperspective from those linked to the broader domain of human-object activity\nunderstanding.

However, bike station-level\ntraffic prediction is difficult because of the spatial-temporal complexity of\nbike sharing systems. Moreover, such level of prediction over entire bike\nsharing systems is also challenging due to the large number of bike stations.\nTo fill this gap, we propose BikeMAN, a multi-level spatio-temporal attention\nneural network to predict station-level bike traffic for entire bike sharing\nsystems. The proposed network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an\nattention mechanism representing the spatial correlation between features of\nbike stations in the system and another attention mechanism describing the\ntemporal characteristic of bike station traffic. Through experimental study on\nover 10 millions trips of bike sharing systems (> 700 stations) of New York\nCity, our network showed high accuracy in predicting the bike station traffic\nof all stations in the city.",

      "abstract": "Classical computation, grounded in formal, logical systems, has been the\nengine of technological progress for decades, excelling at problems that can be\ndescribed with unambiguous rules. This paradigm, however, leaves a vast ocean\nof human problems -- those characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments,\nand subjective context -- largely untouched. The advent of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to\nengage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This\npaper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these\nproblem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces\naddressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the\nformer problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter\nrequires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking\ninto account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural\nlanguage. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects\nsolution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions\nfrom the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language\nsolutions. Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality\ndimensions. Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual\ndiversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations.\nEmotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable\nmetric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures. The concepts\nintroduced in this work will provide a more rigorous understanding of the\ncapabilities, limitations, and inherent nature of problem-solving in the age of\nLLMs.",

      "abstract": "Segments in computer vision are often defined by semantic considerations and\nare highly dependent on category-specific conventions. In contrast,\ndevelopmental psychology suggests that humans perceive the world in terms of\nSpelke objects--groupings of physical things that reliably move together when\nacted on by physical forces. Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic\ncausal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like\nmanipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object\nconcept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of\nwell-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke\nsegments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual\nworld models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet\nsupports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the\nmotion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)\nthe expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.\nThese concepts are used for \"statistical counterfactual probing\", where diverse\n\"virtual pokes\" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the\nresultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as\nstatistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet\noutperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench.\nFinally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream\napplications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for\nphysical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object\nmanipulation models.",

      "abstract": "We investigate the extent to which Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) trained\nwith Surrogate Gradient Descent (Surrogate GD), with and without delay\nlearning, can learn from precise spike timing beyond firing rates. We first\ndesign synthetic tasks isolating intra-neuron inter-spike intervals and\ncross-neuron synchrony under matched spike counts. On more complex spike-based\nspeech recognition datasets (Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech\nCommands (SSC), we construct variants where spike count information is\neliminated and only timing information remains, and show that Surrogate\nGD-trained SNNs are able to perform significantly above chance whereas purely\nrate-based models perform at chance level. We further evaluate robustness under\nbiologically inspired perturbations -- including Gaussian jitter per spike or\nper-neuron, and spike deletion -- revealing consistent but\nperturbation-specific degradation. Networks show a sharp performance drop when\nspike sequences are reversed in time, with a larger drop in performance from\nSNNs trained with delays, indicating that these networks are more human-like in\nterms of behaviour. To facilitate further studies of temporal coding, we have\nreleased our modified SHD and SSC datasets.",

      "abstract": "Adversarial examples pose significant threats to deep neural networks (DNNs),\nand their property of transferability in the black-box setting has led to the\nemergence of transfer-based attacks, making it feasible to target real-world\napplications employing DNNs. Among them, feature-level attacks, where\nintermediate features are perturbed based on feature importance weight matrix\ncomputed from transformed images, have gained popularity. In this work, we find\nthat existing feature-level attacks primarily manipulate the semantic\ninformation to derive the weight matrix. Inspired by several works that find\nCNNs tend to focus more on high-frequency components (a.k.a. abstract features,\ne.g., texture, edge, etc.), we validate that transforming images in the\nhigh-frequency space also improves transferability. Based on this finding, we\npropose a balanced approach called Semantic and Abstract FEatures disRuption\n(SAFER). Specifically, SAFER conducts BLOCKMIX on the input image and SELF-MIX\non the frequency spectrum when computing the weight matrix to highlight crucial\nfeatures. By using such a weight matrix, we can direct the attacker to disrupt\nboth semantic and abstract features, leading to improved transferability.\nExtensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset also demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method in boosting adversarial transferability.",

Each study was evaluated using a 59-item\nframework covering dataset construction, feature extraction, validation\nmethods, interpretability, and risk of bias. We extracted key details including\nmodel type, cancer site, imaging modality, and performance metrics such as\naccuracy and area under the curve (AUC). PET-based studies (95%) generally\noutperformed those using SPECT, likely due to higher spatial resolution and\nsensitivity. DRF models achieved the highest mean accuracy (0.862), while\nfusion models yielded the highest AUC (0.861). ANOVA confirmed significant\ndifferences in performance (accuracy: p=0.0006, AUC: p=0.0027). Common\nlimitations included inadequate handling of class imbalance (59%), missing data\n(29%), and low population diversity (19%). Only 48% of studies adhered to IBSI\nstandards.

While ternary NNs demonstrate excellent performance in\npractical applications such as image recognition and natural language\nprocessing, their theoretical understanding remains insufficient. In this\npaper, we theoretically analyze the expressivity of ternary NNs from the\nperspective of the number of linear regions. Specifically, we evaluate the\nnumber of linear regions of ternary regression NNs with Rectified Linear Unit\n(ReLU) for activation functions and prove that the number of linear regions\nincreases polynomially with respect to network width and exponentially with\nrespect to depth, similar to standard NNs. Moreover, we show that it suffices\nto either square the width or double the depth of ternary NNs to achieve a\nlower bound on the maximum number of linear regions comparable to that of\ngeneral ReLU regression NNs. This provides a theoretical explanation, in some\nsense, for the practical success of ternary NNs.",

These parameters can be merged to\nsupport multiple tasks via a process known as task merging. However, prior work\non merging in LLMs, particularly in natural language processing, has been\nlimited to scenarios where each test example addresses only a single task. In\nthis paper, we focus on on-device settings and study the problem of text-based\ncompositional multi-tasking, where each test example involves the simultaneous\nexecution of multiple tasks. For instance, generating a translated summary of a\nlong text requires solving both translation and summarization tasks\nconcurrently. To facilitate research in this setting, we propose a benchmark\ncomprising four practically relevant compositional tasks. We also present an\nefficient method (Learnable Calibration) tailored for on-device applications,\nwhere computational resources are limited, emphasizing the need for solutions\nthat are both resource-efficient and high-performing.

In this work, we propose to\novercome these shortcomings through feedback-based fine-tuning of existing\npersonalized generation methods, wherein, state-of-art detectors of pose,\nhuman-object-interaction, human facial recognition and human gaze-point\nestimation are used to refine the diffusion model.

The process starts with a small set of manually\nannotated regions. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA)-based\nfeature space analysis and construct a confidence index (CI) to expand these\nlabels, producing a weakly supervised training set. These expanded labels are\nthen used to train ViT-based encoder-decoder models with multi-band inputs from\nSentinel-2 and Formosat-5 imagery. Our architecture supports multiple decoder\nvariants and multi-stage loss strategies to improve performance under limited\nsupervision. During the evaluation, model predictions are compared with\nhigher-resolution EVAP output to assess spatial coherence and segmentation\nconsistency. Case studies on the 2022 Poyang Lake drought and the 2023 Rhodes\nwildfire demonstrate that our framework improves the smoothness and reliability\nof segmentation results, offering a scalable approach for disaster mapping when\naccurate ground truth is unavailable.",

The thin structure property of cracks is\nusually overlooked by previous methods. In this work, we introduce CrackCue, a\nnovel method for robust crack detection based on coarse-to-fine crack cue\ngeneration. The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to\ngenerate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we\nfirst employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image.\nThis results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine\ncrack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The\ndifference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a\nfine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is\nunaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting. As a\nplug-and-play method, we incorporate the proposed CrackCue into three advanced\ncrack detection networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed CrackCue significantly improves the generalization ability and\nrobustness of the baseline methods.

Our method uses a\nclustering-based strategy to extract semantic context from training data and\nguide an LLM in producing synthetic CTI sentences that are lexically diverse\nand semantically faithful. We evaluate SynthCTI on two publicly available CTI\ndatasets, CTI-to-MITRE and TRAM, using LLMs with different capacity.\nIncorporating synthetic data leads to consistent macro-F1 improvements: for\nexample, ALBERT improves from 0.35 to 0.52 (a relative gain of 48.6\\%), and\nSecureBERT reaches 0.6558 (up from 0.4412).

The Progressive\nAttention Fusion network enhances fine-grained alignment between textual\nfeatures and image regions via hierarchical, multi-stage cross modal\ninteractions, effectively suppressing irrelevant visual noise. Secondly,\nmulti-task contrastive learning combines global modal contrast and local\ngranularity alignment to enhance cross modal representation consistency.\nAdaptive Multi-loss Aggregation employs a dynamic uncertainty based weighting\nmechanism to calibrate loss contributions according to each task's uncertainty,\nthereby mitigating gradient interference.

      "abstract": "As vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world\napplications, new safety risks arise from the subtle interplay between images\nand text. In particular, seemingly innocuous inputs can combine to reveal\nharmful intent, leading to unsafe model responses. Despite increasing attention\nto multimodal safety, previous approaches based on post hoc filtering or static\nrefusal prompts struggle to detect such latent risks, especially when\nharmfulness emerges only from the combination of inputs. We propose SIA (Safety\nvia Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that\nproactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA\nemploys a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning,\n(2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3)\nintent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules\nor classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the\nimage-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks\nincluding SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves\nsubstantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods. Although SIA\nshows a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, the\ncorresponding safety gains highlight the value of intent-aware reasoning in\naligning VLMs with human-centric values.",

However, existing methods suffer from spatial misalignment\nbetween LiDAR and camera features, which causes inaccurate depth supervision in\ncamera branch and erroneous fusion during cross-modal feature aggregation. The\nroot cause of this misalignment lies in projection errors, stemming from\ncalibration inaccuracies and rolling shutter effect. The key insight of this\nwork is that locations of these projection errors are not random but highly\npredictable, as they are concentrated at object-background boundaries which 2D\ndetectors can reliably identify. Based on this, our main motivation is to\nutilize 2D object priors to pre-align cross-modal features before fusion. To\naddress local misalignment, we propose Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC),\nwhich leverages 2D priors to alleviate misalignment and preserve correct\ncross-modal feature pairs. To resolve global misalignment, we introduce\nDiscontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF) to suppress residual noise from\nPGDC and explicitly enhance sharp depth transitions at object-background\nboundaries, yielding a structurally aware representation. To effectively\nutilize these aligned representations, we incorporate Structural Guidance Depth\nModulator (SGDM), using a gated attention mechanism to efficiently fuse aligned\ndepth and image features. Our method achieves SOTA performance on nuScenes\nvalidation dataset, with its mAP and NDS reaching 71.5% and 73.6% respectively",

This paper shifts focus from reasoning\nto perception.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in\nenabling agents to perform multi-step reasoning by optimizing long-term\nrewards. However, conventional RL methods struggle with complex reasoning tasks\ndue to issues such as credit assignment, high-dimensional state\nrepresentations, and stability concerns. Recent advancements in Transformer\narchitectures and hyperbolic geometry have provided novel solutions to these\nchallenges. This paper introduces a new framework that integrates hyperbolic\nTransformers into RL for multi-step reasoning. The proposed approach leverages\nhyperbolic embeddings to model hierarchical structures effectively. We present\ntheoretical insights, algorithmic details, and experimental results that\ninclude Frontier Math and nonlinear optimal control problems. Compared to RL\nwith vanilla transformer, the hyperbolic RL largely improves accuracy by\n(32%~44%) on FrontierMath benchmark, (43%~45%) on nonlinear optimal control\nbenchmark, while achieving impressive reduction in computational time by\n(16%~32%) on FrontierMath benchmark, (16%~17%) on nonlinear optimal control\nbenchmark. Our work demonstrates the potential of hyperbolic Transformers in\nreinforcement learning, particularly for multi-step reasoning tasks that\ninvolve hierarchical structures.",

However, existing studies face three\nmajor limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which\nfails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)\nintroducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;\nand (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like\nrelevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the\nMultimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,\nwhich mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment\nas a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality\nvariations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic\nCorrelation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions\nbetween posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum\ninformation fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level\nEvidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level\nrelational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on\nthree newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public\nLazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3\nimprovement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.",

Following two successful green hydrogen project\nrounds, the country launched its third auction (R3) in the Duqm region. While\nthis area exhibits relative geospatial homogeneity, it is still vulnerable to\nenvironmental fluctuations that pose inherent risks to productivity. Despite\ngrowing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce,\nwith major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence\nproduction until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028. This\nabsence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale\nhydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for\naccurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions.\nGiven this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and\nreliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because\nharsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity\nfluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable\nenergy systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Artificial\nIntelligence decision support system that leverages publicly available\nmeteorological data to develop a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI),\nwhich predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands on hydrogen\ninfrastructure. This tool strengthens regulatory foresight and operational\ndecision-making by enabling temporal benchmarking to assess and validate\nperformance claims over time. It can be used to incorporate temporal risk\nintelligence into auction evaluation criteria despite the absence of historical\noperational benchmarks.",

This\npaper contributes to this inquiry by moving beyond metrics that measure\n\\textit{what} models can do, to a methodology that characterizes \\textit{how}\nthey process information. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic approach to probe\nthese dynamics by creating a quantitative ``Cognitive Profile\" for any given\nmodel. This profile is centered on the \\textbf{Entropy Decay Curve}, a\nvisualization that traces how a model's normalized predictive uncertainty\nchanges as a function of context length. Applying this methodology to several\nstate-of-the-art LLMs across diverse texts, we uncover unique and consistent\ncognitive profiles that are sensitive to both model scale and text complexity.\nWe also introduce the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to summarize the\ndesirability of the decay trajectory. This work thus provides a new, principled\nlens for analyzing and comparing the intrinsic operational dynamics of\nartificial intelligence.",

This blind spot arises because conventional,\nsemantically-driven retrieval methods are not equipped to gather evidence that\nis both topically relevant and temporally coherent for a specified duration. We\naddress this challenge by proposing a new framework that fundamentally\nredesigns the RAG pipeline to infuse temporal logic. Our methodology begins by\ndisentangling a user's query into its core subject and its temporal window. It\nthen employs a specialized retriever that calibrates semantic matching against\ntemporal relevance, ensuring the collection of a contiguous evidence set that\nspans the entire queried period. To enable rigorous evaluation of this\ncapability, we also introduce the Analytical Diachronic Question Answering\nBenchmark (ADQAB), a challenging evaluation suite grounded in a hybrid corpus\nof real and synthetic financial news. Empirical results on ADQAB show that our\napproach yields substantial gains in answer accuracy, surpassing standard RAG\nimplementations by 13% to 27%.

We evaluated methods for predicting serious adverse event\n(SAE) results in clinical trials using information only from their\nregistrations prior to the trial. Material and Methods: We analysed 22,107\ntwo-arm parallel interventional clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov with\nstructured summary results. Two prediction models were developed: a classifier\npredicting will experimental arm have higher SAE rates (area under the receiver\noperating characteristic curve; AUC) than control arm, and a regression model\nto predict the proportion of SAEs in control arms (root mean squared error;\nRMSE). A transfer learning approach using pretrained language models (e.g.,\nClinicalT5, BioBERT) was used for feature extraction, combined with downstream\nmodel for prediction. To maintain semantic representation in long trial texts\nexceeding localised language model input limits, a sliding window method was\ndeveloped for embedding extraction. Results: The best model\n(ClinicalT5+Transformer+MLP) had 77.6% AUC predicting which trial arm has a\nhigher proportion of patients with SAEs. When predicting proportion of\nparticipants experiencing SAE in the control arm, the same model achieved RMSE\nof 18.6%. The sliding window approach consistently outperformed methods without\nit. Across 12 classifiers, the average absolute AUC increase was 2.00%; across\n12 regressors, the average absolute RMSE reduction was 1.58%.

Discrete\ntokenization, with vector quantization (VQ) as a central approach, offers both\ncomputational efficiency and compatibility with LLM architectures. Despite its\ngrowing importance, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey that\nsystematically examines VQ techniques in the context of LLM-based systems. This\nwork fills this gap by presenting the first structured taxonomy and analysis of\ndiscrete tokenization methods designed for LLMs. We categorize 8 representative\nVQ variants that span classical and modern paradigms and analyze their\nalgorithmic principles, training dynamics, and integration challenges with LLM\npipelines. Beyond algorithm-level investigation, we discuss existing research\nin terms of classical applications without LLMs, LLM-based single-modality\nsystems, and LLM-based multimodal systems, highlighting how quantization\nstrategies influence alignment, reasoning, and generation performance. In\naddition, we identify key challenges including codebook collapse, unstable\ngradient estimation, and modality-specific encoding constraints. Finally, we\ndiscuss emerging research directions such as dynamic and task-adaptive\nquantization, unified tokenization frameworks, and biologically inspired\ncodebook learning. This survey bridges the gap between traditional vector\nquantization and modern LLM applications, serving as a foundational reference\nfor the development of efficient and generalizable multimodal systems.

In this, a language model's response to a given prompt about\ngiven text is only correct if it exists in the collection of possible (i.e.,\ncandidate) answers, and text corresponding to incorrect responses is fed into a\nmore predictive (but slower) language model. This process is repeated for a\ncollection of language models, or until all predictions about the text are\ncorrect. We used the LMC algorithm to extract patient dates of birth from\nmedical documents, and combining a collection of language models in a\nmulti-stage cascade significantly increased prediction speed and accuracy over\nindividual language models, while greatly reducing the number of corresponding\nhallucinations.

      "abstract": "Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), their performance varies substantially across different languages and\ntasks. In multilingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based systems,\nknowledge bases (KB) are often shared from high-resource languages (such as\nEnglish) to low-resource ones, resulting in retrieved information from the KB\nbeing in a different language than the rest of the context. In such scenarios,\ntwo common practices are pre-translation to create a mono-lingual prompt and\ncross-lingual prompting for direct inference. However, the impact of these\nchoices remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact\nof different prompt translation strategies for classification tasks with\nRAG-enhanced LLMs in multilingual systems. Experimental results show that an\noptimized prompting strategy can significantly improve knowledge sharing across\nlanguages, therefore improve the performance on the downstream classification\ntask. The findings advocate for a broader utilization of multilingual resource\nsharing and cross-lingual prompt optimization for non-English languages,\nespecially the low-resource ones.",

      "abstract": "Fairness remains a critical concern in healthcare, where unequal access to\nservices and treatment outcomes can adversely affect patient health. While\nFederated Learning (FL) presents a collaborative and privacy-preserving\napproach to model training, ensuring fairness is challenging due to\nheterogeneous data across institutions, and current research primarily\naddresses non-medical applications. To fill this gap, we establish the first\nexperimental benchmark for fairness in medical FL, evaluating six\nrepresentative FL methods across diverse demographic attributes and imaging\nmodalities. We introduce FairFedMed, the first medical FL dataset specifically\ndesigned to study group fairness (i.e., demographics). It comprises two parts:\nFairFedMed-Oph, featuring 2D fundus and 3D OCT ophthalmology samples with six\ndemographic attributes; and FairFedMed-Chest, which simulates real\ncross-institutional FL using subsets of CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR. Together, they\nsupport both simulated and real-world FL across diverse medical modalities and\ndemographic groups. Existing FL models often underperform on medical images and\noverlook fairness across demographic groups. To address this, we propose\nFairLoRA, a fairness-aware FL framework based on SVD-based low-rank\napproximation. It customizes singular value matrices per demographic group\nwhile sharing singular vectors, ensuring both fairness and efficiency.\nExperimental results on the FairFedMed dataset demonstrate that FairLoRA not\nonly achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical image classification but\nalso significantly improves fairness across diverse populations.

However, outcomes\nvary widely, posing a significant challenge for early prediction. To address\nthis, individualized simulation offers a promising solution by modeling\nsubject-specific neurodevelopmental trajectories, enabling the identification\nof subtle deviations from normative patterns that might act as biomarkers of\nrisk. While generative models have shown potential for simulating\nneurodevelopment, prior approaches often struggle to preserve subject-specific\ncortical folding patterns or to reproduce region-specific morphological\nvariations. In this paper, we present a novel graph-diffusion network that\nsupports controllable simulation of cortical maturation. Using cortical surface\ndata from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), we demonstrate that\nthe model maintains subject-specific cortical morphology while modeling\ncortical maturation sufficiently well to fool an independently trained age\nregression network, achieving a prediction accuracy of $0.85 \\pm 0.62$.",
