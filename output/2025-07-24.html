While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime\ncapabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability\nto obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address\nthese limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground\ncross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837\nidentities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and\nfixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents\nunique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,\nand temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel\nthree-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of\ncross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain\ngaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through\nstyle-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and\nintermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR\npresents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our\nTCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple\nevaluation protocols.

In this work, we investigated how size and\nseparability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features\nand performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning\nmodels for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging\nDataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on\nimaging manufacturer) or non-separable \"pseudo-subgroups\". We found that\nsimulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature\nrepresentations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature\nspace were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the\nsubgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in\nsubgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels\nwas used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,\nwith label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive\nrate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean\nlabels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work\nrepresents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label\nbias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.",

Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the\nproximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body\ntransformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has\nremained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.\nThis paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function\nbetween two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation\n($\\mathbf{R}$ and $\\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous\nmathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear\nsubspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we\npropose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be\napplied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector\nparameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal\nsolution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to\nrepresentation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the\ninlier-set maximizing Branch-and-Bound (BnB) solver have been demonstrated to\nimprove the convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various\ncomputer vision tasks.

However, most methods perform material decomposition\nin the image domain as a post-processing step after reconstruction but this\nprocedure does not account for the beam-hardening effect and it results in\nsub-optimal results. In this work, we propose a deep learning procedure called\nDual-Energy Decomposition Model-based Diffusion (DEcomp-MoD) for quantitative\nmaterial decomposition which directly converts the DECT projection data into\nmaterial images. The algorithm is based on incorporating the knowledge of the\nspectral DECT model into the deep learning training loss and combining a\nscore-based denoising diffusion learned prior in the material image domain.\nImportantly the inference optimization loss takes as inputs directly the\nsinogram and converts to material images through a model-based conditional\ndiffusion model which guarantees consistency of the results. We evaluate the\nperformance with both quantitative and qualitative estimation of the proposed\nDEcomp-MoD method on synthetic DECT sinograms from the low-dose AAPM dataset.\nFinally, we show that DEcomp-MoD outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised\nscore-based model and supervised deep learning networks, with the potential to\nbe deployed for clinical diagnosis.",

Due to the need for a large amount of data, a user simulator\nis employed for both training and evaluation. Such user simulators critique the\ncurrent retrieved item based on knowledge of a single target item. However,\nsystem evaluation in offline settings with simulators is limited by the focus\non a single target item and their unlimited patience over a large number of\nturns. To overcome these limitations of existing simulators, we propose\nFashion-AlterEval, a new dataset that contains human judgments for a selection\nof alternative items by adding new annotations in common fashion CRS datasets.\nConsequently, we propose two novel meta-user simulators that use the collected\njudgments and allow simulated users not only to express their preferences about\nalternative items to their original target, but also to change their mind and\nlevel of patience. In our experiments using the Shoes and Fashion IQ as the\noriginal datasets and three CRS models, we find that using the knowledge of\nalternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation\nof existing CRS models, specifically that the existing single-target evaluation\nunderestimates their effectiveness, and when simulatedusers are allowed to\ninstead consider alternative relevant items, the system can rapidly respond to\nmore quickly satisfy the user.",

However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the\ninherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining\nmulti-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting\nframework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted\nviews. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and\nregion-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the\ninpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene\nfiltering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded\nregions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided\nFine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each\nregion across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view\ninconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted\nresults. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate\nthat our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual\nquality and view consistency.",

      "abstract": "Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and\nprivacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial\nexpressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton\nacquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly\nenhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This\nsurvey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion\nrecognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and\nexamine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.\nNext, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in\ndata acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize\nexisting methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them\nfrom both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a\nunified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional\napproaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works\nwithin each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results\nacross commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of\nemotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression\nand autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in\nthis rapidly evolving field.",

This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that\nintegrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations\nwithin a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of\nViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as\nit provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack\nspecificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically\ndivides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates\nthem for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.\nThrough the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency\ndomains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to\ndetect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText\nsignificantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost\nwhen it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise\nfrom 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's\nsuperior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable\ndiffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in\nrecall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted\nattacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits\nclassification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed\nvisual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,\nhelping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.",

However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between\nlanguage descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely\ninvoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In\nthis work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language\ninstructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to\ncomplete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set\nobjects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit\nstrong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language\ninstructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,\nleveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with\nvision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view\nvalue maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial\ninformation from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To\nfurther validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous\nvehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language\nnavigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability\nto execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation\ninstructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and\nlinguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in\nboth indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and\napplicability.

Despite recent advances, these existing\nmethods are inherently intrusive, as they either modify the model parameters or\nalter the structure. This natural intrusiveness raises concerns about\nwatermarking-induced shifts in model behavior and the additional cost of\nfine-tuning, further exacerbated by the rapidly growing model size. As a\nresult, model owners are often reluctant to adopt DNN watermarking in practice,\nwhich limits the development of practical Watermarking as a Service (WaaS)\nsystems. To address this issue, we introduce Nonintrusive Watermarking as a\nService (NWaaS), a novel trustless paradigm designed for X-to-Image models, in\nwhich we hypothesize that with the model untouched, an owner-defined watermark\ncan still be extracted from model outputs. Building on this concept, we propose\nShadowMark, a concrete implementation of NWaaS which addresses critical\ndeployment challenges by establishing a robust and nonintrusive side channel in\nthe protected model's black-box API, leveraging a key encoder and a watermark\ndecoder. It is significantly distinctive from existing solutions by attaining\nthe so-called absolute fidelity and being applicable to different DNN\narchitectures, while being also robust against existing attacks, eliminating\nthe fidelity-robustness trade-off. Extensive experiments on image-to-image,\nnoise-to-image, noise-and-text-to-image, and text-to-image models, demonstrate\nthe efficacy and practicality of ShadowMark for real-world deployment of\nnonintrusive DNN watermarking.",

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that\noperates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS\nuses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to\nidentify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively\nattributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred\noutputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors\nthat capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During\ninference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by\ntoken-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve\nrepresentational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular\ncontrol over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.\nEmpirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing\nsteering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using\nLlama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514\nwith LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all\nwhile preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.",

Inherent\nvariability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further\ncomplicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language\nmodels (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by\ngenerating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.\nMotivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break\nannotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and\nspeech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing\neffectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based\nsynthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break\nprediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the\nspeech domain.",

Most open-source models are trained on datasets\nconsisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn\nand respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition\nawareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to\nidentify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting\ntransitions.\n  To address this, we propose the \\textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)\ndataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene\ntransitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \\textbf{TAV}\ndataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap\nbetween required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.",

ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000\nGPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed\nunexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered\narchitectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically\nsurpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for\narchitectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling\nlaw for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural\nbreakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress\nfrom a human-limited to a computation-scalable process.

However, the speckle\nnoise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of\npancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both\nerror-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To\naddress these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,\ntext-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no\nmanual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt\nlearning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in\nconjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable\nautomatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total\nparameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,\nTextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized\nsurface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice\nand 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised\nDL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first\nattempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,\nTextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS\nsegmentation.

In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that\nautoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language\ninputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including\nVideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information\nfrom prior brain states and current stimuli via dual cross-attention mechanisms\nthat attend to both perceptual information extracted from the stimulus as well\nas narrative information provided by high-level summaries of the content. One\ncore innovation of our approach is the use of sequences of multimodal context\nto predict sequences of brain activity, enabling the model to capture\nlong-range temporal structure in both stimuli and neural responses. Another is\nthe combination of a shared encoder with partial subject-specific decoder,\nwhich leverages common representational structure across subjects while\naccounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong performance on\nboth in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain\nactivity prediction.

However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)\nDropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to\nalign with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose\nthe Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models\ndistributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using\nfree energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a\nfree-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which\nenables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;\nand (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct\nuncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic\nsampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)\nframework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and\nenables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta\ndistribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally\nefficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the\neffectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including\nFishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.",

These agents handle both structured and unstructured\ndata, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing\nrecommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly\navailable datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.\nFor example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured\ndata (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by\nthe Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring\nprivacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize\nit. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based\napproach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage\nMedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.\nThese features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the\nbest-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent\nand Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on\ndata type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent\" runs\nthe selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs\nusing tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps.

However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle\nfor linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker\ncharacteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,\nand non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel\nspoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,\ndesigned to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM\nadopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling\nfrom acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while\nsupporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model\nefficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that\nprogressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic\ninformation using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on\nTELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM\nachieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,\nand outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal\nvariation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance\nof modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more\nnatural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.",

In this study, we propose a novel framework for\ntortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the\nevaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative\napplication scenario.\n  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework\nthat integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates\ndomain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as\ncurvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a\ntarget curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it\nis more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where\nbiologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust\nand objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line\ncomparisons.\n  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess\nthe stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was\napplied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to\nanalyze the difference in this uniformity between \\textit{Demodex}-negative and\n\\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a\nsignificant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,\nwith an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of\n0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework\nin curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for\nquantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support\nclinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case\ndue to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and\nadherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises\nconcerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite\ntheir promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM\nbenchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities\nof LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We\nintroduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question\nanswering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant\nquestions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We\nevaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying\nprompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework\nincorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended\nto better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key\ndimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,\npotential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro\nconsistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of\nthe top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question\ncomplexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform\ngeneral-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of\nperformance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual\nrecall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.\nThese findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to\nensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.",

While diffusion-based methods\nhave shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.\nHowever, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to\ncapture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to\nstructural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that\njointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light\nimages, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing\ngeneration quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from\nlow-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce\nan adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.\nBy leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes\nan implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise\ndistribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the\nmodels ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,\nwe design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color\nrestoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content\nconsistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual\nperception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation\nscenarios.

To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive\ngeometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation\nStage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and\nflexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy\nand dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise\ndeformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,\nwe propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM\nfaces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive\nfacial motions. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GeoAvatar\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and novel animation\nscenarios.",

      "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP\ntasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.\nThese tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity\ntoward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding\ndistances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we\nsystematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and\nintroducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based\non sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model\nfamilies, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that\nthese tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,\nas well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their\npresence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We\nfurther evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and\nretrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through\nattention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately\ndominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about\ntokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization\nstrategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future\ntext embedding applications.",

Inspired by dual-system\ncognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the\ncontribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs\nis decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval\n(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs\nare prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast\nthinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different\ncognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and\nreasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results\nreveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting\nreasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and\npotentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling\nimproves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more\npronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly\nmore prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily\nresides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our\nframework not only helps understand LLMs from a \"decoupling\" perspective, but\nalso provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,\nhierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.",

By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks\nsemantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias\ndistribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the\ninverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability\nof selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents\nsemantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,\nthereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across\nmultiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing\ndebiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed\nclearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus\noffers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM\nevaluations.",

To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (Text Embeddings\nFusion), a novel and efficient distillation method that directly incorporates\nthe guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and distills the teacher\nmodel's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing conditional and\nunconditional text embeddings using linear operations, TeEFusion reconstructs\nthe desired guidance without adding extra parameters, simultaneously enabling\nthe student model to learn from the teacher's output produced via its\nsophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art\nmodels such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the student to closely\nmimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more efficient sampling\nstrategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference speeds up to\n6$\\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image quality at\nlevels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex sampling\napproach.

However,\nthis reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject\npoisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process\ntoward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based\nMasked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter\nout adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact\ntokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key\ntokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked\nLanguage Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low\nmasked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious\ndocuments and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that\nGMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant\ndocuments, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across\ndiverse datasets and adversarial settings.",

In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors\nwill result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and\nerror terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the\nrobot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial\nsignal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In\nthis work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework\nfor accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws\nand constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing\nan accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we\nshow accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN\nis a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used\nin any typical mobile robot application.",

However, existing\nmethods typically transfer the original training process directly without\nspecific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used\npre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.\nBased on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation\nmodel grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we\nreplace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the\nsegmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We\nalso employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the\nconvolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of\nthe original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for\ndifferent disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model\narchitecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation\nduring the inference phase, making it highly efficient.",

In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation\n(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts\nadaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by\ncapturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in\ntarget domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into\ngraph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,\nadaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency\ncomponents, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse\nGFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the\ngraph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an\neigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the\nspectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and\nablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,\noutperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.",

While canonical economic models assume\natomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive\nsingle-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of\nits environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a\nsearch-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL\nagent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify\na parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and\nRL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a\ncalibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a\nrepresentative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost\nfunction to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm\nconverges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with\nthe competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and\ntheoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic\nsystems within the broader domain of computational social science.",

Our results across several\nLLMs and prompt strategies show improvements in consistency, interpretability,\nand performance, with up to 50% accuracy in difficulty prediction tasks.

In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D\nReconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene\nreconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing\nby operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new\nobservation.

To effectively capture\nlong-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically\nprunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution\nalong the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while\nmaintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training\nstrategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate\nthat LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for\nlonger sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed.

By exploiting a diverse\narray of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against\nvarious challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for\nreal-world reconstruction.

Subsequently, these constraints are\nencoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive\nbehavior to dynamic disturbances.

      "abstract": "Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions\nglobally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions\nand lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample\nMendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental\ntraits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess\nmediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the\nlargest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823\ndental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from\nthe Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance\nweighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed\nusing the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect\nof dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one\nstandard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a\n188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =\n1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital\ncapacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting\nfor 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for\nperiodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung\ncancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function\nmonitoring into cancer prevention strategies.",

Our approach stresses the need for an analysis\nof AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and\nmulti-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we\nprovide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In\nparticular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the\ninteraction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,\nincorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments\nabout the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach\nallows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and\nGeneral Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the\nlatter.

While LMMs have demonstrated\npromising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual\nquestion answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of\nLMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the\ngap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors\nwith LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a\nLarge Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on\nspecialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive\nexploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,\nrevealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist\ndetection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by\nintroducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored\nfor object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance\nthe object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a\nlarge multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra\ndetection modules.

      "abstract": "Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a \"pre-training and fine-tuning\"\nparadigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to\nvarious specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most\nwidespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and\nremarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is\nrelatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA\nfine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).\nHowever, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more\ninformation leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we\nintroduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the\nfine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership\ninference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that\nleverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply\nLoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language\nprocessing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still\nvulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).\nWe also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the\nresulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only\ndropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively\nmitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the\n\"pre-training and fine-tuning\" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model\nmakes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can\nprovide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.",

      "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities\nacross a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such\nas image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on\nlarge-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge\nvisual perception and natural language processing. However, their application\nto scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly\nused in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce\nFieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'\nunderstanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a\nfield-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model\ntuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a\nspecial-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from\nfield data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.\nThis information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that\nserve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on\nLVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to\nreduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative\nvalues. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides\nits learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods\nin tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this\napproach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models\nto scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and\ndomain-specific discovery.",

These ice clouds can\nalter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of\naviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail\nformation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality\nof atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex\nprocesses like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.\nObservational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,\ncould be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing\ndatasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they\ntypically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their\nsource flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible\nCamera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded\nwith a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is\nindividually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its\nlifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and\nincludes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As\nreference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail\nanalysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic\nsegmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual\ncontrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By\nproviding high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for\nmodel evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will\nfacilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for\nmore accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.",

Unlike previous approaches\nthat restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we\nintroduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate\ngeometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and\ndynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the\nrepresentation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse\nvolume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with\nhigh occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant\ncomputation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework\nachieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better\nstill, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating\nthe dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200\nand ARKitScenes datasets.

We hypothesize that birds can be classified by\nvisualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called\nmotifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar\nmotifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency\ninformation into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances\nspecies distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show\nthat the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models\nwithout colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by\n7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.",

      "abstract": "Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel\nby learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel\nplug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and\nfeedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can\ncapture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing\ndeformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement\nfield and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than\ndirectly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative\ndeformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation\nand the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the\nfundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep\nlearning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the\nproposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same\nconfiguration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the\nart performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated\nthat the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly\nlearn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model\nrepresentation and generalization capabilities. The proposed module is similar\nto the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more\nmachine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.",

The inherent randomness in\ndiffusion models helps address issues such as blurring at the edges of medical\nimages and labels, positioning Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) as a\npromising approach for lesion segmentation. However, we find that the current\ntraining and inference strategies of diffusion models result in an uneven\ndistribution of attention across different timesteps, leading to longer\ntraining times and suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose UniSegDiff, a\nnovel diffusion model framework designed to address lesion segmentation in a\nunified manner across multiple modalities and organs. This framework introduces\na staged training and inference approach, dynamically adjusting the prediction\ntargets at different stages, forcing the model to maintain high attention\nacross all timesteps, and achieves unified lesion segmentation through\npre-training the feature extraction network for segmentation. We evaluate\nperformance on six different organs across various imaging modalities.\nComprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UniSegDiff significantly\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches.

The core of the system is a recommendation model trained on\nhighly sensitive user-item interaction data. While privacy-enhancing techniques\nare actively studied in the research community, the real-world model\ndevelopment still depends on minimal privacy protection, e.g., via controlled\naccess. Users of such systems should have the right to choose \\emph{not} to\nshare highly sensitive interactions. However, there is no method allowing the\nuser to know which interactions are more sensitive than others. Thus,\nquantifying the privacy risk of RecSys training data is a critical step to\nenabling privacy-aware RecSys model development and deployment. We propose a\nmembership-inference attack (MIA)- based privacy scoring method, RecPS, to\nmeasure privacy risks at both the interaction and user levels. The RecPS\ninteraction-level score definition is motivated and derived from differential\nprivacy, which is then extended to the user-level scoring method. A critical\ncomponent is the interaction-level MIA method RecLiRA, which gives high-quality\nmembership estimation. We have conducted extensive experiments on well-known\nbenchmark datasets and RecSys models to show the unique features and benefits\nof RecPS scoring in risk assessment and RecSys model unlearning.",

Despite\nsubstantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic\n4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel\nframework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by\ncombining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,\nMVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and\nspatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for\ndownstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to\noptimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal\ndomain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances\ntemporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key\nchallenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior\n4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate\nthat MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and\ntime efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens\nstructural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR\nexperiences.

      "abstract": "Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate\nrepresentations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or\nautoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental\nlimitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose\ngeneration where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel\none-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate\nspace from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while\nmaintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key\ninnovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or\ntoken-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a\nrelative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,\nand a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation\nwith identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive\nexperiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)\ndatasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing\nquantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term\ngeneration scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to\nacquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering\nunder arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material\nmaps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of\nconstraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.\nPrevious works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for\ntraining, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to\nrendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further\nalleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)\nbased on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the\nnormal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and\nsubsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially\nfor the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using\nan end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance\namong various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we\ndesign a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full\nuse of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the\nperformance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial\nmaterial results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a\nfinetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map\nhas different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled\nPBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be\noptimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on\nOpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively\nincentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\ntrajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,\nexisting approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the\ndevelopment of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a\ntheoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information\nbottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),\na framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about\nthe final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a\npractical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient\napproximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This\ntechnique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks\nwithout additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code\nmodification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent\nimprovements in LLM reasoning performance.",

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error\nanalysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates\na set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each\nidentified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard\nthat allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate\nvisualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score\nranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular\nbehavioral pattern.

      "abstract": "Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to\nenhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep\nnetworks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional\nfeature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized\nmechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we\npropose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It\nintroduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy\nquantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other\nfeatures. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation\narchitecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature\nexpression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg\ndatasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by\n1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)\nand 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).\nThe results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods\nacross all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and\nachieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical\nusability.",

Since every condition on a set of finite\ndomain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table\ncan, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make\nTable one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of\nincreasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon\nto encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that\nare simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based\napproaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the\nstate-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be\nenhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs\nto handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and\nimplementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing\nconstraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant\nset of instances.",

This process\nrequires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning\n(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful\nrepresentations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data\nis limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include\nV-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level\nreconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited\nto ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail\nwhile effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.\nSimilar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is\nwell-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small\nmedical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and\nabsence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we\npropose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT\nrepresentations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our\nauxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various\nfrozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\\% using 100\\% and up to\n8.35\\% using only 10\\% of the training data.",

In this\npaper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with\nlimited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This\nmethod is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker\ndecomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional\nclassification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as\na regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation\nof pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each\nEuler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension\nof the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.\nAlmost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.\nHence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our\ntraining set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering\nthe corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited\ntraining data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an\nobject from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around\neach axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data.

      "abstract": "Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot\nlocalization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable\nperformance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address\nthis, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former\n(DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block\nclustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling\nbidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from\nthe final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details\nthrough self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared\ncross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block\nclustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large\n(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data\norganization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.\nTogether, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable\nto environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by\napproximately 30\\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like\nDELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution\nusing 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational\nefficiency.",

      "abstract": "Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential\nrisk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance\nsystems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly\nenhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in\ndescribing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual\nevidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed\nunderstanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal\nModels (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists\nof two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'\nunderstanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid\nvisual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from\nthe internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we\npropose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM\ninstruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like\nMLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'\ngeneralizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on\nfine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap\nbetween MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on\nquestion-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs\nfine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition\ntasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention\nprediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to\n11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.",

This paper aims to\nconduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by\nformulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)\nthe purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation\nmethods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,\nGoogle Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating\nsynthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant\narticles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given\nto the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main\npurpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,\ncorpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer\narchitectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,\nespecially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of\nevaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where\nutility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic\nmedical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a\nmoderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream\nNLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the\nreal documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming\nsparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind\ngenerating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to\ncheck for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in\ngenerating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of\nworkflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of\ndata transfer.",

In this work, we tackle\nunsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based\nframework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained\nvision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead\nof training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation\nmodels as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level\nrepresentations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of\nthe Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the\nlength of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale\nfeatures. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using\nfeatures from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction\ntowards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four\ndiverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art\nresults on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA.

However, these\napproaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,\nlimiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a\nproactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction\nwith the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial\ncontexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate\nprediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes\ndefense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves\nan uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient\npolicy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting\nreal-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.\nComprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating\na substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard\naccuracy across diverse tasks.

The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of\nencoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all\nthese models share some representations or features.

In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the\nfirst general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)\nmodels, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To\ndynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we\nfirst introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the\ncausal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical\ncoarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key\ncomponents: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for\nevaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or\nrejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain\nsufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity\nsearch. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,\nenabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,\nresampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using\npotential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating\nmulti-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity\nshow a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights\nreveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final\nquality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales.

Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and\naccurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained\nMulti-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from\nhundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits\nand lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that\nintegrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping\nstrategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a\nglobal space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,\nwe formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic\nProcrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing\nprobabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain\ncorrespondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within\nminutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization\nframework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from\nconfidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering\nwith an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling\naccurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI\ndatasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed\nimage sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS\nreconstruction.",

      "abstract": "Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help\ninterpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large\nsize and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for\ndirect human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional\nclassifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined\nconcepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural\nnetworks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being\nprobed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data\nrequired to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.\nFocusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we\ninvestigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their\nperformance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used\ndatasets.",

      "abstract": "Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe\nmodality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To\naddress this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS\nmatching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific\nmatching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from\npreoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a\nshared descriptor space.\n  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify\nanatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a\ncurriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to\nlearn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and\nlimited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects\nkeypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are\nthen used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D\nMRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with\nan average precision of $69.8\\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a\ncompetitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg\nbenchmark.\n  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is\ninterpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS\nfield-of-view variation.

The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for\ntesting), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual\ndescriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three\nhierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface\nto depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.\nVideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent\nexpressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and\nare not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated\nusing a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through\nstep-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,\nplace, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition\ntasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually\nvalidated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design\nhybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval\nmetrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results\nfor models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a\npowerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields\nrequiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.\nThe data is publicly available on GitHub, HuggingFace, and OpenDataLab,\nhttps://github.com/cdx-cindy/VideoMind.",

Our experimental results demonstrate a\nsignificant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a\ncompetitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,\nwe analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific\nchallenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals.

Demorphing\n- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide\nadditional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the\nmorph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the\nmorph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same\nmorph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method\ndecomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from\nunseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created\nfrom synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using different\nmorph techniques.

Nevertheless, its reliance on the\nreverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode\ncollapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent\ndrawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework\nthat leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions\nbetween real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial\nmanner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we\nfurther improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with\nhybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean\nsquared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the\ndistributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus\nproviding a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the\nnext stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM\nfine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves\nsuperior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU\ntime. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on\nSD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient\nimage and video synthesis.",

Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and\ngeneralization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.\nFurthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,\nScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks.

Moreover,\ncustomizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any\ntask. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful\ndata synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3\nwhile utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates\nthat our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source\ncode, models, and scripts are available at https://github.com/Krueske/AQuilt.",

We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO\nprecoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter\nwhile dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy\nconsumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model\nsignificantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean\nsquared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation\nin data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds\ntraining samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine\nsimilarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work\nenables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing\nchallenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability\nto dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher\nlevel resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over\nenergy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.",

      "abstract": "The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is\ncrucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with\nhumans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the\nincreased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained\ndynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce Moving\nOut, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a wide range of\ncollaboration modes affected by physical attributes and constraints, such as\nmoving heavy items together and maintaining consistent actions to move a big\nitem around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two tasks and collected\nhuman-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities to adapt to diverse\nhuman behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address the challenges in\nphysical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS (Behavior Augmentation,\nSimulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of agents and their\nunderstanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show that BASS\noutperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI collaboration. The\nproject page is available at https://live-robotics-uva.github.io/movingout_ai/.",

While existing work\nhas made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as\nHTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software\nstill remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation\nusually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control\nspecific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to\nhandle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.\nTo address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel\nrequirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal\ntraceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis\nis built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a\ngranular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural\nlanguage requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a\ncomprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of\n3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification\nlanguage capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D\nsoftware synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis\nenables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic\nconstraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis\naccurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%\nof hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.\nFurthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual\nevaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.",

To enable adaptation without\ntarget images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text\ndescription to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous\nachievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven\nmethods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly\nincrease adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on\ntext descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides\ndiverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a\nnovel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic\nimages. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like\nimages and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.\nWe then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the\ntarget domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style\nTransfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In\nparticular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain\nrepresentations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to\nindividual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing\nstate-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,\nparticularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high\nefficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.",

To support\nstable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,\nwe introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion\nTransformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our\nmodel is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of\ninterleaved data pairs.

While traditional\nmodels like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle\nto generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in\nvision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer\npromising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In\nthis work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze\nits performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and\nshape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to\nsuppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only\nclass-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent\nbehavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual\ncues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating\nclass-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce\nattention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification\naccuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a\ndiscussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and\noutline directions for future work to improve generalizability across\ndomain-independent healthcare scenarios.",

      "abstract": "The unloaded cardiac geometry (i.e., the state of the heart devoid of luminal\npressure) serves as a valuable zero-stress and zero-strain reference and is\ncritical for personalized biomechanical modeling of cardiac function, to\nunderstand both healthy and diseased physiology and to predict the effects of\ncardiac interventions. However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical\nimages remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse\nfinite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are\ncomputationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep\nlearning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape\ndirectly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating\nbiophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with\nphysiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and\nfiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts\na graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to\nenable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial\nself-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training\ndatasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV\ngeometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter\naccuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing\ninference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and\nsignificantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation\nstudies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the\ncycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as\nfew as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate\nsurrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in\nthe future.",

Unlike the\nabundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors\nand laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that\nconverts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic\n3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and\npseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale\ncalibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery\nand the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically\ngenerating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce\ndata collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence.\nWe release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D,\nand demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can\nbenefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based\nreasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for\ndeveloping AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting\nwith physical environments.",

Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing\nliquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk,\ncompetition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL,\nparticularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop\nautonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.\n  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning\nproblem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and\nmulti-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then\naddresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary\napproaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\n(MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the\nlatter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing\nobjectives.\n  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS,\na novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This\nmethod allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,\nenabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.\n  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches\nsignificantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across\nvarious performance metrics. Overall, this research thesis contributes new\nmethodologies and insights for the design of robust, efficient, and adaptive\nmarket making agents, reinforcing the potential of RL to transform algorithmic\ntrading in complex financial systems.",

Neural radiance\nfield (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting\nof implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving\nscenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through\nrasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors,\npreventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both\nNeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit\nnetworks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing\ninteroperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present\nSparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports\nrasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D\nvoxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast\ntraining (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS\nLiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes,\nand can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs. We demonstrate that\nSaLF has similar realism as existing self-driving sensor simulation methods\nwhile improving efficiency and enhancing capabilities, enabling more scalable\nsimulation. https://waabi.ai/salf/",

In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data\nhas an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the\nobservation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology\n``un-pruning\" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we\npropose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by\nretained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be\nintegrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is\nupper-bounded in theory. Also, our un-pruning algorithm can be applied to both\nstructured sparse models and unstructured sparse models. In the experiment, we\nfurther find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for\nassessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the\namount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results. Accordingly, we\ndevise new performance metrics for sparse models to evaluate the success of\nun-pruning. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of\nun-pruning with various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms.

Through a case study on a large-scale pavement\nnetwork of 68,800 segments, the proposed DRL framework demonstrates significant\nimprovements over traditional methods like Progressive Linear Programming and\ngenetic algorithms, both in efficiency and network performance. This\nadvancement contributes to infrastructure asset management and the broader\napplication of reinforcement learning in complex, large-scale environments.",

In this\ncontext, images are reconstructed from linearly compressed measurements. In\npractice, total variation minimisation is still used to reconstruct the image\nfrom noisy measurements of the inner product between orthogonal sampling\npattern vectors and the original image data. However, data can be leveraged to\nlearn the measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, thereby enhancing\ncompression, reconstruction quality, and speed. We train an autoencoder through\nself-supervision to learn an encoder (or measurement matrix) and a decoder. We\nthen test it on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data. During\nacquisition, the learned encoder becomes part of the physical device. Our\napproach can enhance single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy by\nreducing reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, achieving superior\nimage quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions. Ultimately, learned\nsingle-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological\nresearch, providing multispectral imaging at a fraction of the cost.",

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\nimagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet\nthe lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its\nsemantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and\nhigh-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To\nconstruct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which\ngenerates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive\ntransfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT\ndataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks:\nimage-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA).\nSpecifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT:\nSAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable\nimprovements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and\n10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the\ncaptioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding\nthose of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In\nthe VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple\nSAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning\nability, as further confirmed by qualitative results.

In this work, we develop an\nEngineering Agent that fixes the source code based on test failures at scale\nacross diverse software offerings internally.\n  Method: Using Llama as the base, we employ the ReAct harness to develop an\nagent. We start with a test failure that was triaged by a rule-based test\nfailure bot. We then set up an agentic harness and allow the agent to reason\nand run a set of 15 actions from reading a file to generating a patch. We\nprovide feedback to the agent through static analysis and test failures so it\ncan refine its solution. We leverage an LLM-as-a-Judge to ensure that the patch\nconforms to the standards followed by a human review to land fixes.\n  Benchmark Findings: We curated offline benchmarks for our patch generator,\nthe Engineering Agent loop, and the LLM-as-a-Judge. In offline evaluations we\nfound that a specialized 70B model is highly competitive with the much larger\nbut vanilla Llama-405B. In an ablation study, we found that the ReAct harness\n(neural model) benefited from the symbolic information from static analysis\ntools and test execution traces. A model that strikes a balance between the\nsolve rate and error rate vs the cost and latency has a benchmark solve rate of\n42.3% using an average 11.8 feedback iterations.\n  Production Findings: In a three month period, 80% of the generated fixes were\nreviewed, of which 31.5% were landed (25.5% of the total number of generated\nfixes).\n  Feedback from Engineers: We used open coding to extract qualitative themes\nfrom engineers' feedback. We saw positive feedback in the form of quick\napprovals, gratitude, and surprise. We also found mixed feedback when the\nEngineering Agent's solution was partially correct and it served as a good\nstarting point.",

While conventional methods require per-instance\noptimization, recent feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate 3D\nGaussians with a learnable network. However, these methods predict Gaussians\nfor each frame independently, without fully capturing the relations of\nGaussians from different timestamps. To address this, we propose Human Gaussian\nGraph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh,\nso that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable\nhuman representation. Specifically, the Human Gaussian Graph contains dual\nlayers where Gaussians are the first layer nodes and mesh vertices serve as the\nsecond layer nodes. Based on this structure, we further propose the intra-node\noperation to aggregate various Gaussians connected to one mesh vertex, and\ninter-node operation to support message passing among mesh node neighbors.\nExperimental results on novel view synthesis and novel pose animation\ndemonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method.",

Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the\nentire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to\nestimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road\nregion. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a\nBEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame\ndrivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using\nonly monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several\nchallenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space\ncorridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel\nself-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future\nego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual\ncorridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion\nprocess to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the\nexisting binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations.\nTherefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture\nthat denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask\nrepresentations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions.\nWe evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and\nCARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal\nnavigable corridors in the image.",

In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between\nsubsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling\nalgorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables\npredicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state\nobservations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This\npaper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static\nfeatures. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics\nof the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to\nenable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together\nmixtures of \"persistence\" and \"emergence\" filters to model the probability that\nfeatures will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The\napproach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating\nthe states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at\narbitrary future times. Through experiments on simulated and real-world data,\nwe find that Perpetua yields better accuracy than similar approaches while also\nbeing online adaptable and robust to missing observations.",

While LLMs can generate syntactically correct\nsolutions for well-structured programming tasks, they often struggle with\nchallenges that require iterative debugging, error handling, or adaptation to\ndiverse problem structures. Existing approaches such as fine-tuning or\nself-repair strategies either require costly retraining or lack mechanisms to\naccumulate and reuse knowledge from previous attempts.\n  To address these limitations, we propose MemoCoder, a multi-agent framework\nthat enables collaborative problem solving and persistent learning from past\nfixes. At the core of MemoCoder is a Fixing Knowledge Set, which stores\nsuccessful repairs and supports retrieval for future tasks. A central Mentor\nAgent supervises the repair process by identifying recurring error patterns and\nrefining high-level fixing strategies, providing a novel supervisory role that\nguides the self-repair loop. We evaluate MemoCoder across three public\nbenchmarks -- MBPP, HumanEval, and LiveCodeBench -- spanning a range of problem\ncomplexities. Experimental results show that MemoCoder consistently outperforms\nboth zero-shot prompting and a Self-Repair strategy, with improvements ranging\nfrom 3.1% to 12.1% in Pass@10 and from 1.4% to 14.5% in Pass@50, demonstrating\nits effectiveness in iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation.",

Videos and images\ngenerated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more\ndifficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new\nmodels to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted\nto solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly\ninteracts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using\nsolely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of\nboth deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an\napproach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on\nidentifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image\nprocessing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction\ntechnique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial\nlandmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance\nmetrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings\ndiscussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models\nwith accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering\naround 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing\nis necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature\nextraction approach compatible with various neural network models while\nrequiring fewer parameters.",

Our model employs a tri-plane volumetric feature representation --\ni.e., the projection of 3D features onto three canonical planes. We introduce a\nnovel tri-plane feature design in which features on the horizontal plane are\nequivariant to 90{\\deg} rotations, while the sum of features from the other two\nplanes remains invariant to the same transformations. This design is enabled by\na new deformable steerable convolution, which combines the adaptability of\ndeformable convolutions with the rotational equivariance of steerable ones.\nThis allows the receptive field to adapt to local object geometry while\npreserving equivariance properties. We further develop equivariant adaptations\nof two state-of-the-art volumetric grasp planners, GIGA and IGD. Specifically,\nwe derive a new equivariant formulation of IGD's deformable attention mechanism\nand propose an equivariant generative model of grasp orientations based on flow\nmatching. We provide a detailed analytical justification of the proposed\nequivariance properties and validate our approach through extensive simulated\nand real-world experiments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed\nprojection-based design significantly reduces both computational and memory\ncosts. Moreover, the equivariant grasp models built on top of our tri-plane\nfeatures consistently outperform their non-equivariant counterparts, achieving\nhigher performance with only a modest computational overhead.

Existing MIL methods face challenges\nin aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While\nViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally\nintensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To\naddress these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token\nClustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt\ntokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in\nan end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks,\nusing projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity\nwhile preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based\npooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive\nexperiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in\nclassification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art\nmethods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong\ninterpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.",

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on\nhardware modifications, complex modulation, or cumbersome data-driven\nreconstruction, our method operates with a single modulation frequency and\nconstructs the sensing matrix using multiple phase shifts and narrow-duty-cycle\ncontinuous waves. During matrix construction, we further account for pixel-wise\nrange variation caused by lens distortion, making the sensing matrix better\naligned with actual modulation response characteristics. To enhance sparse\nrecovery, we apply K-Means clustering to the distance response dictionary and\nconstrain atom selection within each cluster during the OMP process, which\neffectively reduces the search space and improves solution stability.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms\ntraditional approaches in both reconstruction accuracy and robustness, without\nrequiring any additional hardware changes.",

We analyze\nboth instrumental justifications (democratic approaches produce better\noutcomes) and non-instrumental justifications (democratic approaches prevent\nillegitimate authority or coercion). We argue that normative and metanormative\nuncertainty create a justificatory gap that democratic approaches aim to fill\nthrough political rather than theoretical justification. However, we identify\nsignificant challenges for democratic approaches, particularly regarding the\nprevention of illegitimate coercion through AI alignment. Our analysis suggests\nthat neither purely epistocratic nor purely democratic approaches may be\nsufficient on their own, pointing toward hybrid frameworks that combine expert\njudgment with participatory input alongside institutional safeguards against AI\nmonopolization.",

To lower their efforts and promote inclusiveness, we aim to\nautomatically detect and correct Web accessibility violations in HTML code.\nWhile previous work has made progress in detecting certain types of\naccessibility violations, the problem of automatically detecting and correcting\naccessibility violations remains an open challenge that we address. We\nintroduce a novel taxonomy classifying Web accessibility violations into three\nkey categories - Syntactic, Semantic, and Layout. This taxonomy provides a\nstructured foundation for developing our detection and correction method and\nredefining evaluation metrics. We propose a novel method, AccessGuru, which\ncombines existing accessibility testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs)\nto detect violations and applies taxonomy-driven prompting strategies to\ncorrect all three categories. To evaluate these capabilities, we develop a\nbenchmark of real-world Web accessibility violations. Our benchmark quantifies\nsyntactic and layout compliance and judges semantic accuracy through\ncomparative analysis with human expert corrections. Evaluation against our\nbenchmark shows that AccessGuru achieves up to 84% average violation score\ndecrease, significantly outperforming prior methods that achieve at most 50%.",

The proposed system leverages DRL algorithms to dynamically\nmanage the integration of renewable energy sources, energy storage, and grid\npower, adapting to fluctuating energy availability in real time. The study\ndemonstrates that the DRL-optimized system achieves a 38\\% reduction in energy\ncosts, significantly outperforming traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nmethods (28\\%) and heuristic approaches (22\\%). Additionally, it maintains a\nlow SLA violation rate of 1.5\\%, compared to 3.0\\% for RL and 4.8\\% for\nheuristic methods. The DRL-optimized approach also results in an 82\\%\nimprovement in energy efficiency, surpassing other methods, and a 45\\%\nreduction in carbon emissions, making it the most environmentally friendly\nsolution. The system's cumulative reward of 950 reflects its superior\nperformance in balancing multiple objectives. Through rigorous testing and\nablation studies, the paper validates the effectiveness of the DRL model's\narchitecture and parameters, offering a robust solution for energy management\nin data centers.

These approaches, spanning\nuni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, demonstrate notable precision and\nadaptability in controlled settings, effectively identifying manipulations\nthrough advanced learning techniques and cross-modal fusion.

This work presents the\nfirst systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern\nagent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without\nsacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much\ncomplexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules\nyield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the\ndesign of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA\nbenchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework\ndesigns, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we\nquantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our\nfindings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework\nthat has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains\n96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while\nreducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%\nimprovement in cost-of-pass.

      "abstract": "Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) represent one of the largest\nmachine learning applications on the planet. Industry-scale DLRMs are trained\nwith petabytes of recommendation data to serve billions of users every day. To\nutilize the rich user signals in the long user history, DLRMs have been scaled\nup to unprecedented complexity, up to trillions of floating-point operations\n(TFLOPs) per example. This scale, coupled with the huge amount of training\ndata, necessitates new storage and training algorithms to efficiently improve\nthe quality of these complex recommendation systems. In this paper, we present\na Request-Only Optimizations (ROO) training and modeling paradigm. ROO\nsimultaneously improves the storage and training efficiency as well as the\nmodel quality of recommendation systems. We holistically approach this\nchallenge through co-designing data (i.e., request-only data), infrastructure\n(i.e., request-only based data processing pipeline), and model architecture\n(i.e., request-only neural architectures). Our ROO training and modeling\nparadigm treats a user request as a unit of the training data. Compared with\nthe established practice of treating a user impression as a unit, our new\ndesign achieves native feature deduplication in data logging, consequently\nsaving data storage. Second, by de-duplicating computations and communications\nacross multiple impressions in a request, this new paradigm enables highly\nscaled-up neural network architectures to better capture user interest signals,\nsuch as Generative Recommenders (GRs) and other request-only friendly\narchitectures.",

      "abstract": "Accurate forecasting of commodity price spikes is vital for countries with\nlimited economic buffers, where sudden increases can strain national budgets,\ndisrupt import-reliant sectors, and undermine food and energy security. This\npaper introduces a hybrid forecasting framework that combines historical\ncommodity price data with semantic signals derived from global economic news,\nusing an agentic generative AI pipeline. The architecture integrates\ndual-stream Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with attention mechanisms to\nfuse structured time-series inputs with semantically embedded, fact-checked\nnews summaries collected from 1960 to 2023. The model is evaluated on a 64-year\ndataset comprising normalized commodity price series and temporally aligned\nnews embeddings. Results show that the proposed approach achieves a mean AUC of\n0.94 and an overall accuracy of 0.91 substantially outperforming traditional\nbaselines such as logistic regression (AUC = 0.34), random forest (AUC = 0.57),\nand support vector machines (AUC = 0.47). Additional ablation studies reveal\nthat the removal of attention or dimensionality reduction leads to moderate\ndeclines in performance, while eliminating the news component causes a steep\ndrop in AUC to 0.46, underscoring the critical value of incorporating\nreal-world context through unstructured text. These findings demonstrate that\nintegrating agentic generative AI with deep learning can meaningfully improve\nearly detection of commodity price shocks, offering a practical tool for\neconomic planning and risk mitigation in volatile market environments while\nsaving the very high costs of operating a full generative AI agents pipeline.",
