      "abstract": "Advancements in volume visualization (VolVis) focus on extracting insights\nfrom 3D volumetric data by generating visually compelling renderings that\nreveal complex internal structures. Existing VolVis approaches have explored\nnon-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness,\nand informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods\noften rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single\nstyle, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we\nadvocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian\nprimitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style\ntransfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives\ntightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization\nresults. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian\nsplatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives,\nextending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes,\nresulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced\nlighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving\nflexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance\nstylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing\ntailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing\nwith fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and\nquantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its\nsuperiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and\nediting flexibility.",

These point clouds often contain substantial\nnoise, leading to inaccurate surface reconstructions. Inspired by the\nNoise2Noise paradigm for 2D images, we introduce NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF, a novel\nmethod designed to extend this concept to 3D neural fields. Our approach\nenables learning clean neural SDFs directly from noisy point clouds through\nnoisy supervision by minimizing the MSE loss between noisy SDF representations,\nallowing the network to implicitly denoise and refine surface estimations. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF on benchmarks, including the\nShapeNet, ABC, Famous, and Real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour framework significantly improves surface reconstruction quality from noisy\ninputs.",

Unfortunately, dominant approaches\nrely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to\nsharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur\npatterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based\nframework, dubbed \\ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying\ntexture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \\ours performs DM to generate\nthe prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To\nimplement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a\nmemory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for\nDM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the\nTexture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel\nFilter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes\nspatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we\nimplement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture\ndetails. Extensive evaluations show that \\ours provides a promising\nunsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used\nbenchmarks.",

Many\ncompliance-related queries are multi-hop, requiring synthesis of information\nacross interlinked clauses. This poses a challenge for traditional\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. To overcome this, we introduce\nBifrostRAG: a dual-graph RAG-integrated system that explicitly models both\nlinguistic relationships (via an Entity Network Graph) and document structure\n(via a Document Navigator Graph). This architecture powers a hybrid retrieval\nmechanism that combines graph traversal with vector-based semantic search,\nenabling large language models to reason over both the meaning and the\nstructure of the text. Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset shows that\nBifrostRAG achieves 92.8 percent precision, 85.5 percent recall, and an F1\nscore of 87.3 percent. These results significantly outperform vector-only and\ngraph-only RAG baselines that represent current leading approaches. Error\nanalysis further highlights the comparative advantages of our hybrid method\nover single-modality RAGs. These findings establish BifrostRAG as a robust\nknowledge engine for LLM-driven compliance checking. Its dual-graph, hybrid\nretrieval mechanism offers a transferable blueprint for navigating complex\ntechnical documents across knowledge-intensive engineering domains.",

To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion\nLikelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of\nintegrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus\nof expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood\nfrom the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a\nsegmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method\neffectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational\ncamera motion, and parallel motion.

Traditional Particle Swarm Optimization\n(PSO) methods, while effective for offline planning, often struggle with\npremature convergence and latency in real-time scenarios. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose PE-PSO, an enhanced PSO-based online trajectory\nplanner. The method introduces a persistent exploration mechanism to preserve\nswarm diversity and an entropy-based parameter adjustment strategy to\ndynamically adapt optimization behavior. UAV trajectories are modeled using\nB-spline curves, which ensure path smoothness while reducing optimization\ncomplexity. To extend this capability to UAV swarms, we develop a multi-agent\nframework that combines genetic algorithm (GA)-based task allocation with\ndistributed PE-PSO, supporting scalable and coordinated trajectory generation.\nThe distributed architecture allows for parallel computation and decentralized\ncontrol, enabling effective cooperation among agents while maintaining\nreal-time performance. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed\nframework outperforms conventional PSO and other swarm-based planners across\nseveral metrics, including trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle\navoidance, and computation time. These results confirm the effectiveness and\napplicability of PE-PSO in real-time multi-UAV operations under complex\nenvironmental conditions.",

      "abstract": "The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to\ngenerate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole\nusage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of\nhybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF\nrepresentation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar\ngeneration qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their\ndeformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the\ndeformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational\ncosts on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points\nare located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but\nresult in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we\npropose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel\nefficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In\nEPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray\nomission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that\nprogress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval\non the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.\nThe delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational\ncost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important\nregions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without\nhierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the\ngeneration quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around\n20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.\nWe provide video results on https://github.com/seungjun-moon/epsilon.",

When a student combines several steps in one step, the number of possible\npaths connecting consecutive inputs may be very large. This combinatorial\nexplosion makes error diagnosis hard. Using a final answer to diagnose a\ncombination of steps can mitigate the combinatorial explosion, because there\nare generally fewer possible (erroneous) final answers than (erroneous)\nsolution paths. An intermediate input for a task can be diagnosed by\nautomatically completing it according to the task solution strategy and\ndiagnosing this solution. This study explores the potential of automated error\ndiagnosis based on a final answer. We investigate the design of a service that\nprovides a buggy rule diagnosis when a student combines several steps. To\nvalidate the approach, we apply the service to an existing dataset (n=1939) of\nunique student steps when solving quadratic equations, which could not be\ndiagnosed by a buggy rule service that tries to connect consecutive inputs with\na single rule. Results show that final answer evaluation can diagnose 29,4% of\nthese steps. Moreover, a comparison of the generated diagnoses with teacher\ndiagnoses on a subset (n=115) shows that the diagnoses align in 97% of the\ncases. These results can be considered a basis for further exploration of the\napproach.",

Image restoration\nhas emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed\nin the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made\nremarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity\nposes significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in\nreal-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to\nsimplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or\nstate space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network\narchitecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration\nitself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative\npipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image\nrestoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient\nrestoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).\nSpecifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block\nlevel, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to\nachieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the\nintra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative\nto self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity\nwhile preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks\nsuch as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion\ndeblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light\nenhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art\nmethods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with\nsignificantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.",

      "abstract": "In 3D hand-object interaction (HOI) tasks, estimating precise joint poses of\nhands and objects from monocular RGB input remains highly challenging due to\nthe inherent geometric ambiguity of RGB images and the severe mutual occlusions\nthat occur during interaction.To address these challenges, we propose MaskHOI,\na novel Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-driven pretraining framework for enhanced HOI\npose estimation. Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction\nstrategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and\nstructural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and\nocclusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our\nobservation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than\nrigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the\nreconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the\nregion-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking\nguidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions\nthan to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the\nlatter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire\nfingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world\ninteractions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained\nencoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven\nmultimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the\nlearned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and\nobjects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of\nmonocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art\napproaches.",

This heterogeneity\nposes significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To\naddress these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for\ncooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras\n(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that\nadaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial\nattention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality\nfeature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an\nadaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance\ncomputational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across\ndifferent configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy\nthat dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments\non the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%\n3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D\nbaseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC\nscenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine\nheterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our\nfirst-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the\ncurrent state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust\nperformance across diverse sensor deployments.",

As conversation\nhistories become longer, existing large language models face increasing\ncomputational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide\nefficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either\ncompress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on\nfixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and\nunpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper,\nwe present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework\nfor large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two\nmain innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the\nprefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the\nattention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value\ncompression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient\ncache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new\nbenchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query\npositions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to\nexisting baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide\nrange of long-context dialogue tasks.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved\nremarkable success in generating realistic and diverse visual content. A\ncritical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret\ntextual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative\nexpressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly\ndescriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach\ntailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:\npoetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.\nOur proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that\nis lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage\nprompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of\npoetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion\nmodels by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent\nself-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then\ncollectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research\nin the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting\nof 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a\npanel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both\nhuman and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and\ncontribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced\ninformation capture in the generated images.",

One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based\ngenerative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of\nproducing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of\nhow such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of\nStyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such\nas the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the\nmodel's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,\nenabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is\nrevealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without\ndrastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational\nrequirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily\ninfluences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global\nalterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while\ntargeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of\nspecific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of\nacademic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential\nmisuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to\nfabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context\nof digital deception and cybercrime.",

Relying solely on real-world driving\nscenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While\nautomatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models\nrequire extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the\noutput. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a\ndistributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the\nvalidity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep\nthis, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting\noriginal scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual\naugmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet\nthe demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore,\nthis paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting\nreal-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing\nthe limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic\ndesign, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high\nperformance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert\nevaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user\nintent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created\nmanually.",

Our\nframework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal\ntrainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions.\nExtensive experiments on CUB-200, \\emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that\nDiffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on\npreviously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.",

However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion\nrepresentation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing\napproaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video\nframes, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to\ninconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free\nEncapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both\nvisual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach\nutilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video\nframes by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing\nthem with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to\nensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior\ninto the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of\nboth types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion\nquality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach\ncompared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a\nsignificant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time. Source codes:\nhttps://github.com/Tonniia/EVS.",

Leveraging the powerful ability\nof the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can\nsignificantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To\nfurther improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the\nSpectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover\nthe HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST\nand BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing\nnetworks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI\nreconstruction.",

In this\nstudy, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through\na novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and\ncomputationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis\nbut rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and\npropose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction\napproach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,\ndiagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the\ndiscriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image\ndescriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and\nedge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an\nimage. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is\nused to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid\nsearch. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,\nincluding Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers\ncompetitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.\nOur results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a\ncompact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive\nand limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of\nentropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight\nand generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image\nclassification and computer vision.",

We\npresent an advanced deep learning model for synthesizing 7T brain MRI from 3T\nbrain MRI. Paired 7T and 3T T1-weighted images were acquired from 172\nparticipants (124 cognitively unimpaired, 48 impaired) from the Swedish\nBioFINDER-2 study. To synthesize 7T MRI from 3T images, we trained two models:\na specialized U-Net, and a U-Net integrated with a generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN U-Net). Our models outperformed two additional state-of-the-art\n3T-to-7T models in image-based evaluation metrics. Four blinded MRI\nprofessionals judged our synthetic 7T images as comparable in detail to real 7T\nimages, and superior in subjective visual quality to 7T images, apparently due\nto the reduction of artifacts. Importantly, automated segmentations of the\namygdalae of synthetic GAN U-Net 7T images were more similar to manually\nsegmented amygdalae (n=20), than automated segmentations from the 3T images\nthat were used to synthesize the 7T images. Finally, synthetic 7T images showed\nsimilar performance to real 3T images in downstream prediction of cognitive\nstatus using MRI derivatives (n=3,168). In all, we show that synthetic\nT1-weighted brain images approaching 7T quality can be generated from 3T\nimages, which may improve image quality and segmentation, without compromising\nperformance in downstream tasks.

Pre-trained diffusion models have been\nincreasingly used as image priors to generate fine details.

We propose\nDynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any\nblindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry\nimages and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the\nstarting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during\nthe diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce\na dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across\nlocal regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving\nstructural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the\ntrade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations,\ndemonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.",

However, in\nreal-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains\noccluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that\nexisting monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC\nframework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's\neffective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish\naccurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past,\npresent, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods\nthat rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more\nrobust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships.\nComprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our\napproach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and\n3D scene completion accuracy.",

However, existing systems often face challenges: high model\ncomplexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,\nunidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and\nrobustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient\nand robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the\nlinear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,\ncombined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among\nmodalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality\nalignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive\nlow-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities\npost-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant\nadaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the\nfusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On\nthe SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower\nerror than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance\nboost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity\nrecognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),\noutperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while\ntraining less than 0.3% of parameters.

However, most existing approaches\ngenerally require the training of separate backbone networks for each data\nmodality, leading to redundancy and inefficient parameter utilization.\nMoreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised\nlearning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating\nthe characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated\nsemantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present\nSkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to\nhandle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL\nstrategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2\nincorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality\nprompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited\nfeature diversity across modalities. In additional, we incorporate the mixture\nof experts (MoE) module to further enhance the performance of the foundation\nmodel.

      "abstract": "Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a critical task with\napplications in diverse domains such as social networks, recommendation\nsystems, and e-commerce platforms. While existing Temporal Graph Neural\nNetworks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex\narchitectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer\nfrom scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead.\nIn this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates\nshort-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE\nconsists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most\nrecent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware\nmodule that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence\nof globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an\nadaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on\ndata characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop\nmessage passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant\nimprovements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal\ngraphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance\nagainst state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency,\ndelivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.",

However,\ntransferring knowledge across agents remains challenging in non-stationary\nenvironments with changing goals. [Problem] Traditional knowledge transfer\nmethods in MARL struggle to generalize, and agents often require costly\nretraining to adapt. [Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge\ntransfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal\nrepresentations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the\nenvironment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive\nrecovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention\ninstantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect\ncorresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while\nincreasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative\nreward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent\nand is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by\nquerying a lookup model with local context information (collisions). [Results]\nOur findings reveal two key insights: (1) agents with heterogeneous goals were\nable to bridge about half of the gap between random exploration and a fully\nretrained policy when adapting to new environments, and (2) the impact of\ncausal knowledge transfer depends on the interplay between environment\ncomplexity and agents' heterogeneous goals.",

Additionally, existing methods assume\nthat camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios\nlike crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that\nintegrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit\nstructural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional\nground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a\npoint cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts\nexplicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously\nextracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to\nsample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a\nper-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to\nenhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark\ndataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters\ninstead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in\nscenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.",

Due to the\nrise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method\nto increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is\nstill a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and\ntrustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have\nno control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already\nincluded in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that\nevaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a\nnatural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL\ngeneration, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with \"anonymized\" knowledge\ninjection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of\nthe training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will\nhelp to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly\nbe achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf.\nLLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any\nknowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM,\ns.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is\npossible.",

To this end, we introduce PositionIC, a unified\nframework that enforces position and identity consistency for multi-subject\ncustomization. We construct a scalable synthesis pipeline that employs a\nbidirectional generation paradigm to eliminate subject drift and maintain\nsemantic coherence. On top of these data, we design a lightweight positional\nmodulation operation that decouples spatial embeddings among subjects, enabling\nindependent, accurate placement while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve precise spatial control\nwhile maintaining high consistency in image customization tasks.

Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics\nand structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and\ndifficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic\nlatent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by\nnavigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our\nframework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains,\ninput formats, and creative tasks.

      "abstract": "COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted increasing\nattention due to its remarkable performance in reconstructing high-quality 3D\nscenes from unposed images or videos. However, it often struggles to handle\nscenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and\ntranslation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of\ncamera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and\n3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that\nachieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose\nco-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The\nfirst is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO\nfeatures from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for\ncamera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency\nregularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further\noptimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over\nmultiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior\npose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.",

In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable\ngeometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR\ndata in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized\nin LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited\nexpressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative\ncapability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted\nby DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to\nenrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we\npropose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature\nextraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global\nsemantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.\nTo effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a\nbidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local\ncues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method\nconsistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of\nincorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object\ndetection.",

Traditional machine learning and deep learning rely\non supervised learning, which requires large quantities of labeled data that\nare costly and time-consuming to obtain in the case of gene expression data.\nSelf-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to\novercome these limitations by extracting information directly from the\nstructure of unlabeled data. In this study, we investigate the application of\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data\nfor phenotype prediction. We selected three self-supervised methods, based on\ndifferent approaches, to assess their ability to exploit the inherent structure\nof the data and to generate qualitative representations which can be used for\ndownstream predictive tasks. By using several publicly available gene\nexpression datasets, we demonstrate how the selected methods can effectively\ncapture complex information and improve phenotype prediction accuracy. The\nresults obtained show that self-supervised learning methods can outperform\ntraditional supervised models besides offering significant advantage by\nreducing the dependency on annotated data. We provide a comprehensive analysis\nof the performance of each method by highlighting their strengths and\nlimitations. We also provide recommendations for using these methods depending\non the case under study. Finally, we outline future research directions to\nenhance the application of self-supervised learning in the field of gene\nexpression data analysis.

However, these degradation kernels, which model the\ntransition from a high-resolution (HR) image to its LR version, should account\nfor not only the degradation process but also the downscaling factor. Applying\nthe same degradation kernel across varying super-resolution scales may be\nimpractical. Our research acknowledges degradation kernels and scaling factors\nas pivotal elements for the BSR task and introduces a novel strategy that\nutilizes HR images as references to establish scale-aware degradation kernels.\nBy employing content-irrelevant HR reference images alongside the target LR\nimage, our model adaptively discerns the degradation process. It is then\napplied to generate additional LR-HR pairs through down-sampling the HR\nreference images, which are keys to improving the SR performance. Our\nreference-based training procedure is applicable to proficiently trained blind\nSR models and zero-shot blind SR methods, consistently outperforming previous\nmethods in both scenarios. This dual consideration of blur kernels and scaling\nfactors, coupled with the use of a reference image, contributes to the\neffectiveness of our approach in blind super-resolution tasks.",

For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views\nand inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital\nrealm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive\nexperiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition\nbetween day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing\nnovel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling\nremains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this\nend, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance\nfields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our\nmodel with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us\nto construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and\nfurther enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.\nFinally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.\nExperiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting\nwithout per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic\nnovel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing\nintricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk.",

DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static\ntoken from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing\nstatic content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates\nthree key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a\ntime-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing\nstatic information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention\nthat routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens\nframe-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual\nstatic-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using\nswap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms\nstate-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest\nswap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic\ntransfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.",

Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual\ndifferences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity\npatterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational\nprinciple. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common\ntrajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its\ntransformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We\nintroduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining\ninter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this\nframework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we\nreveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two\npathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal\nstream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is\ncaptured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing\nthe specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a\nconvergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and\nartificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.",

In\nthis paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's\nperceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time\nhorizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including\nthose trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw\npixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible\nby a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision\nbackbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the\nfrozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight,\ntask-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we\nintroduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties\ndirectly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine\nmodels and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging\nrepresentation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video\nunderstanding.",

The primacy effect-where items presented first are\nmore likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice\nQuestion Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect\nprediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We\nfirst show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to\nhuman-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering\nresponse options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring\nknowledge of the correct answer.

However, diagnosing AD remains a significant\nchallenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection\nbias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention\nframework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal\nIntervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language\nmodel (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining\nstructured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.\nThe ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)\nimages and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into\nCognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of\nconfounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,\nnon-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,\ngenerating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates\nconfounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the\noutstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,\nachieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics.

While Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have gained gradual attention in recent years, by their\nstrong semantic understanding and reasoning abilities, they are not inherently\ndesigned to model chronologically evolving user preference and intentions. On\nthe other hand, for sequential models like LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) which\nis good at capturing the temporal dynamics of user behaviour and evolving user\npreference over time, but still lacks a rich semantic understanding for\ncomprehensive recommendation generation. In this study, we propose DUALRec\n(Dynamic User-Aware Language-based Recommender), a novel recommender that\nleverages the complementary strength of both models, which combines the\ntemporal modelling abilities of LSTM networks with semantic reasoning power of\nthe fine-tuned Large Language Models. The LSTM component will capture users\nevolving preference through their viewing history, while the fine-tuned LLM\nvariants will leverage these temporal user insights to generate next movies\nthat users might enjoy. Experimental results on MovieLens-1M dataset shows that\nthe DUALRec model outperforms a wide range of baseline models, with\ncomprehensive evaluation matrices of Hit Rate (HR@k), Normalized Discounted\nCumulative Gain (NDCG@k), and genre similarity metrics.

While recent personalization methods have explored the\ndecomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion\nmodels. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a\npromising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving\nperformance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore\nVAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation\nprocess for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel\nmethod that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating\noptimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their\nrespective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method\nto mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented\nKey-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark\nthis task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for\ncontent-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various\nartistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior\napproaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.",

Replacing a local HBM stack on an XPU with a chiplet\nthat connects to the Photonic Fabric increases its memory capacity and\ncorrespondingly its memory bandwidth by offering a flexible path to scaling\nwell beyond the limitations of on-package HBM alone.

Aiming\nto classify and segment tunnel cracks with enhanced accuracy and efficiency,\nthis study proposes a two-step deep learning-based method. An automatic tunnel\nimage classification model is developed using the DenseNet-169 in the first\nstep. The proposed crack segmentation model in the second step is based on the\nDeepLabV3+, whose internal logic is evaluated via a score-weighted visual\nexplanation technique. Proposed method combines tunnel image classification and\nsegmentation together, so that the selected images containing cracks from the\nfirst step are segmented in the second step to improve the detection accuracy\nand efficiency. The superior performances of the two-step method are validated\nby experiments. The results show that the accuracy and frames per second (FPS)\nof the tunnel crack classification model are 92.23% and 39.80, respectively,\nwhich are higher than other convolutional neural networks (CNN) based and\nTransformer based models. Also, the intersection over union (IoU) and F1 score\nof the tunnel crack segmentation model are 57.01% and 67.44%, respectively,\noutperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the provided visual\nexplanations in this study are conducive to understanding the \"black box\" of\ndeep learning-based models.

      "abstract": "Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs)\ndue to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear\ncomputational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression\ntechnique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision\nMamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we\nfind that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to\nVision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily\nbecause Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most\ntoken reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance\nmeasurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token\nimportance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further\npropose MTR, a training-free \\textbf{M}amba \\textbf{T}oken \\textbf{R}eduction\nframework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our\nmethod can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various\nMamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly\nreduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across\nvarious tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by\napproximately 40\\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\\% drop in ImageNet\nperformance without retraining.",

One such algorithm\nis the Snake Optimizer (SO), a progressive optimization approach. However, SO\nsuffers from the issues of slow convergence speed and susceptibility to local\noptima. In light of these shortcomings, we propose a novel Multi-strategy\nImproved Snake Optimizer (MISO). Firstly, we propose a new adaptive random\ndisturbance strategy based on sine function to alleviate the risk of getting\ntrapped in a local optimum. Secondly, we introduce adaptive Levy flight\nstrategy based on scale factor and leader and endow the male snake leader with\nflight capability, which makes it easier for the algorithm to leap out of the\nlocal optimum and find the global optimum. More importantly, we put forward a\nposition update strategy combining elite leadership and Brownian motion,\neffectively accelerating the convergence speed while ensuring precision.\nFinally, to demonstrate the performance of MISO, we utilize 30 CEC2017 test\nfunctions and the CEC2022 test suite, comparing it with 11 popular algorithms\nacross different dimensions to validate its effectiveness. Moreover, Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in various fields due to its\nadvantages of low cost, high mobility and easy operation. However, the UAV path\nplanning problem is crucial for flight safety and efficiency, and there are\nstill challenges in establishing and optimizing the path model. Therefore, we\napply MISO to the UAV 3D path planning problem as well as 6 engineering design\nproblems to assess its feasibility in practical applications.

Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, D2IP delivers superior\nimage quality, with a 24.8% increase in average MSSIM and an 8.1% reduction in\nERR, alongside significantly reduced computational time (7.1x faster),\nhighlighting its promise for clinical dynamic pulmonary imaging.",

Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning,\nrevealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably,\npersisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within\nthis idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other\nsources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid\nadaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to\ninvestigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual\nlearning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating\nconcurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to\nmodulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native\nmultitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam\nintroduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps.\nInspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently\nenhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we\npropose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that\napproximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of\nknowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We\nevaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of\nthe MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that\nuncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap.\nFinally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic\nfunctions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing\nstability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.",

While traditional deep learning models require\nsignificant computational resources and centralized data management, the\nresulting latency, bandwidth consumption, and privacy concerns have exposed\ncritical limitations in cloud-centric paradigms. Brain-inspired computing,\nparticularly Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), offers a promising alternative by\nemulating biological neuronal dynamics to achieve low-power, event-driven\ncomputation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Edge Intelligence\nbased on SNNs (EdgeSNNs), examining their potential to address the challenges\nof on-device learning, inference, and security in edge scenarios. We present a\nsystematic taxonomy of EdgeSNN foundations, encompassing neuron models,\nlearning algorithms, and supporting hardware platforms. Three representative\npractical considerations of EdgeSNN are discussed in depth: on-device inference\nusing lightweight SNN models, resource-aware training and updating under\nnon-stationary data conditions, and secure and privacy-preserving issues.\nFurthermore, we highlight the limitations of evaluating EdgeSNNs on\nconventional hardware and introduce a dual-track benchmarking strategy to\nsupport fair comparisons and hardware-aware optimization. Through this study,\nwe aim to bridge the gap between brain-inspired learning and practical edge\ndeployment, offering insights into current advancements, open challenges, and\nfuture research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ndedicated and comprehensive survey on EdgeSNNs, providing an essential\nreference for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of\nneuromorphic computing and edge intelligence.",

To accelerate development of transparent, reproducible,\nand robust AI solutions, we present Glucose-ML, a collection of 10 publicly\navailable diabetes datasets, released within the last 7 years (i.e., 2018 -\n2025). The Glucose-ML collection comprises over 300,000 days of continuous\nglucose monitor (CGM) data with a total of 38 million glucose samples collected\nfrom 2500+ people across 4 countries. Participants include persons living with\ntype 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and no diabetes. To support\nresearchers and innovators with using this rich collection of diabetes\ndatasets, we present a comparative analysis to guide algorithm developers with\ndata selection. Additionally, we conduct a case study for the task of blood\nglucose prediction - one of the most common AI tasks within the field. Through\nthis case study, we provide a benchmark for short-term blood glucose prediction\nacross all 10 publicly available diabetes datasets within the Glucose-ML\ncollection. We show that the same algorithm can have significantly different\nprediction results when developed/evaluated with different datasets. Findings\nfrom this study are then used to inform recommendations for developing robust\nAI solutions within the diabetes or broader health domain.

Despite their\nimportance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For\ninstance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III\n(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\\%$ of hospital visits include progress\nnotes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the\ndataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different\naspects of care.\n  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered\nEvidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by\nsimulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress\nnotes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal\nalignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into\nstructured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically\ninformed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant\ncontent from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to\nprompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and\ntemporally aware progress notes.\n  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and\ncomplete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong\nlongitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,\nsurpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative\ncoherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved\ndownstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical\ndecision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in\nreal-world healthcare settings.",

We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU,\nBN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method\nresponds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on\nthe algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain\nanonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models\ninadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the\nstrong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns.\nThese results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization\nand emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining\ndetection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization\ntechniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often\noverlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility.\nThrough comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a\ncompelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands\nof anomaly detection.",

      "abstract": "Humans have a selective memory, remembering relevant episodes and forgetting\nthe less relevant information. Possessing awareness of event memorability for a\nuser could help intelligent systems in more accurate user modelling, especially\nfor such applications as meeting support systems, memory augmentation, and\nmeeting summarisation. Emotion recognition has been widely studied, since\nemotions are thought to signal moments of high personal relevance to users. The\nemotional experience of situations and their memorability have traditionally\nbeen considered to be closely tied to one another: moments that are experienced\nas highly emotional are considered to also be highly memorable. This\nrelationship suggests that emotional annotations could serve as proxies for\nmemorability. However, existing emotion recognition systems rely heavily on\nthird-party annotations, which may not accurately represent the first-person\nexperience of emotional relevance and memorability. This is why, in this study,\nwe empirically examine the relationship between perceived group emotions\n(Pleasure-Arousal) and group memorability in the context of conversational\ninteractions. Our investigation involves continuous time-based annotations of\nboth emotions and memorability in dynamic, unstructured group settings,\napproximating conditions of real-world conversational AI applications such as\nonline meeting support systems. Our results show that the observed relationship\nbetween affect and memorability annotations cannot be reliably distinguished\nfrom what might be expected under random chance. We discuss the implications of\nthis surprising finding for the development and applications of Affective\nComputing technology. In addition, we contextualise our findings in broader\ndiscourses in the Affective Computing and point out important targets for\nfuture research efforts.",

The presence of multiple identical objects\nwithin a scene often leads to ambiguities for appearance-based feature matching\nalgorithms. Our work circumvents this challenge by exclusively employing\ngeometrical constraints, specifically epipolar geometry, for feature\nassociation. We introduce C-DOG (Connected delta-Overlap Graph), an algorithm\ndesigned for robust geometrical feature association, even in the presence of\nnoisy feature detections. In a C-DOG graph, two nodes representing 2D feature\npoints from distinct views are connected by an edge if they correspond to the\nsame 3D point. Each edge is weighted by its epipolar distance. Ideally, true\nassociations yield a zero distance; however, noisy feature detections can\nresult in non-zero values. To robustly retain edges where the epipolar distance\nis less than a threshold delta, we employ a Szymkiewicz--Simpson coefficient.\nThis process leads to a delta-neighbor-overlap clustering of 2D nodes.\nFurthermore, unreliable nodes are pruned from these clusters using an\nInter-quartile Range (IQR)-based criterion. Our extensive experiments on\nsynthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG not only outperforms geometry-based\nbaseline algorithms but also remains remarkably robust under demanding\nconditions. This includes scenes with high object density, no visual features,\nand restricted camera overlap, positioning C-DOG as an excellent solution for\nscalable 3D reconstruction in practical applications.",

However, their unpredictability,\ncombined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous\nevaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research\nand to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.\n  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts\n(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included\ncomplete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as\nidentifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of\nTask 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.\nSubmissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation\nfrom biomedical experts.\n  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,\nwith models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In\nmanual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of\nfactual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,\nreference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.\nIn Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying\nhow to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems\ndid well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not\nin brevity.\n  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to\nadapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting\ntheir deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.",

      "abstract": "Accurate classification of computed tomography (CT) images is essential for\ndiagnosis and treatment planning, but existing methods often struggle with the\nsubtle and spatially diverse nature of pathological features. Current\napproaches typically process images uniformly, limiting their ability to detect\nlocalized abnormalities that require focused analysis. We introduce UGPL, an\nuncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a\nglobal-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity\nand then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach\nemploys evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding\nthe extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression\nmechanism that maintains spatial diversity. This progressive refinement\nstrategy, combined with an adaptive fusion mechanism, enables UGPL to integrate\nboth contextual information and fine-grained details. Experiments across three\nCT datasets demonstrate that UGPL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving improvements of 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% in accuracy for\nkidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively. Our\nanalysis shows that the uncertainty-guided component provides substantial\nbenefits, with performance dramatically increasing when the full progressive\nlearning pipeline is implemented.

      "abstract": "Bridge maintenance and safety are essential for transportation authorities,\nand Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques are critical to assessing\nstructural integrity. However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and\nrequires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements\nin Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this\nanalysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities\nfor interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in\nproviding detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for\nintegrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted\nanalysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study,\nseveral LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the\nquality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different\nNDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions.\nEach LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed\ndescriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and\ndemonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine\nmodels provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of\ntopics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models\nare summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of\nthe bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more\neffective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to\nsignificantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an\ninnovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and\nsummarization, enabling faster decision-making in bridge maintenance and\nenhancing infrastructure management and safety assessments.",

      "abstract": "The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources has created an\nurgent need for automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances\nin LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models achieve low\nsuccess rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an\nautomated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization that employs a\nnovel contrastive RL algorithm.\n  CUDA-L1 achieves significant performance improvements on the CUDA\noptimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of\nx3.12 with a median speedup of x1.42 across all 250 CUDA kernels of\nKernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x120. Furthermore, the model also\ndemonstrates portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups\nof x3.12 on L40, x2.50 on RTX 3090, x2.39 on H100, and x2.37 on H20 despite\nbeing optimized specifically for A100.\n  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that, RL can transform an initially\npoor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based\nreward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. This\nparadigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and\nholds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising\npressure on GPU computing resources. We also identify important challenges\nposed by training RL models for tasks like CUDA development, where RL often\nlearns to exploit loopholes in reward functions rather than solve the intended\noptimization problems. By identifying these failure modes and analyzing their\nroot causes, we develop practical methods for creating more robust training\nprocedures that prevent reward hacking.",

This study presents an empirical evaluation of KANs in context\nof class imbalanced classification, using ten benchmark datasets. We observe\nthat KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data more effectively\nthan Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy. However,\nconventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical\nstructure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade\nKANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs. Crucially, KANs suffer from\nprohibitive computational costs without proportional performance gains.\nStatistical validation confirms that MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve\nequivalence with KANs (|d| < 0.08 across metrics) at minimal resource costs.\nThese findings reveal that KANs represent a specialized solution for raw\nimbalanced data where resources permit. But their severe performance-resource\ntradeoffs and incompatibility with standard resampling techniques currently\nlimits practical deployment. We identify critical research priorities as\ndeveloping KAN specific architectural modifications for imbalance learning,\noptimizing computational efficiency, and theoretical reconciling their conflict\nwith data augmentation.

However, in many real-world applications, data are\nhigh-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of\nirregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is\ncritical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information.\nIn this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the\ntransformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set\nof latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that\nintegrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor\ndecomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks\nusing the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and\nextracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design\nto enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm\nconverges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in\ntheoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor\ndecomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic\nhealth record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both\nphenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability\nof causal representations.",

      "abstract": "We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source\n(data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases\nsurpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2,\nCLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training\npipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and\na subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in\nSSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to\nlarge codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to\naccount for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we\nintroduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on\nnested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features\ninto increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,\nenabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a\nnovel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional\nbiases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic\ncontent. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions\nestablish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and\nopen a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for\nthe broader AI community.

However, successful attacks on these systems can lead to\nsevere consequences. Recent research on threats targeting ViT models primarily\nfocuses on generating the smallest adversarial perturbations that can deceive\nthe models with high confidence, without considering their impact on model\ninterpretations. Nevertheless, the use of interpretation models can effectively\nassist in detecting adversarial examples. This study investigates the\nvulnerability of transformer models to adversarial attacks, even when combined\nwith interpretation models. We propose an attack called \"AdViT\" that generates\nadversarial examples capable of misleading both a given transformer model and\nits coupled interpretation model. Through extensive experiments on various\ntransformer models and two transformer-based interpreters, we demonstrate that\nAdViT achieves a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box\nscenarios. In white-box scenarios, it reaches up to 98% misclassification\nconfidence, while in black-box scenarios, it reaches up to 76%\nmisclassification confidence. Remarkably, AdViT consistently generates accurate\ninterpretations in both scenarios, making the adversarial examples more\ndifficult to detect.",

Meanwhile, a UAM system, serving as an air taxi,\nrequires adaptive planning to respond to real-time passenger requests,\nespecially in ride-sharing scenarios where passenger demands are unpredictable\nand dynamic. However, conventional trajectory planning strategies based on\npredefined routes lack the flexibility to meet varied passenger ride demands.\nTo address these challenges, this work first proposes constructing a radio map\nto evaluate the communication quality of urban airspace. Building on this, we\nintroduce a novel Multi-Source Hybrid Attention Reinforcement Learning\n(MSHA-RL) framework for the challenge of effectively focusing on passengers and\nUAM locations, which arises from the significant dimensional disparity between\nthe representations. This model first generates the alignment among diverse\ndata sources with large gap dimensions before employing hybrid attention to\nbalance global and local insights, thereby facilitating responsive, real-time\npath planning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the approach\nenables communication-compliant trajectory planning, reducing travel time and\nenhancing operational efficiency while prioritizing passenger safety.",

      "abstract": "We present Fast Approximate Minimum Spanning Tree (FAMST), a novel algorithm\nthat addresses the computational challenges of constructing Minimum Spanning\nTrees (MSTs) for large-scale and high-dimensional datasets. FAMST utilizes a\nthree-phase approach: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) graph construction,\nANN inter-component connection, and iterative edge refinement. For a dataset of\n$n$ points in a $d$-dimensional space, FAMST achieves $\\mathcal{O}(dn \\log n)$\ntime complexity and $\\mathcal{O}(dn + kn)$ space complexity when $k$ nearest\nneighbors are considered, which is a significant improvement over the\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time and space complexity of traditional methods.\n  Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that FAMST achieves\nremarkably low approximation errors while providing speedups of up to\n1000$\\times$ compared to exact MST algorithms. We analyze how the key\nhyperparameters, $k$ (neighborhood size) and $\\lambda$ (inter-component edges),\naffect performance, providing practical guidelines for hyperparameter\nselection. FAMST enables MST-based analysis on datasets with millions of points\nand thousands of dimensions, extending the applicability of MST techniques to\nproblem scales previously considered infeasible.",

We present an\narchitecture where a minimal lean index resolves to dynamic, cryptographically\nverifiable AgentFacts that supports multi-endpoint routing, load balancing,\nprivacy-preserving access, and credentialed capability assertions. Our\narchitecture design delivers five concrete guarantees: (1) A quilt-like index\nproposal that supports both NANDA-native agents as well as third party agents\nbeing discoverable via the index, (2) rapid global resolution for newly spawned\nAI agents, (3) sub-second revocation and key rotation, (4) schema-validated\ncapability assertions, and (5) privacy-preserving discovery across\norganisational boundaries via verifiable, least-disclosure queries. We\nformalize the AgentFacts schema, specify a CRDT-based update protocol, and\nprototype adaptive resolvers. The result is a lightweight, horizontally\nscalable foundation that unlocks secure, trust-aware collaboration for the next\ngeneration of the Internet of AI agents, without abandoning existing web\ninfrastructure.",

      "abstract": "Over the past decade, higher education has evolved through three distinct\nparadigms: the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), the\nintegration of Smart Teaching technologies into classrooms, and the rise of\nAI-enhanced learning. Each paradigm is intended to address specific challenges\nin traditional education: MOOCs enable ubiquitous access to learning resources;\nSmart Teaching supports real-time interaction with data-driven insights; and\ngenerative AI offers personalized feedback and on-demand content generation.\nHowever, these paradigms are often implemented in isolation due to their\ndisparate technological origins and policy-driven adoption. This paper examines\nthe origins, strengths, and limitations of each paradigm, and advocates a\nunified pedagogical perspective that synthesizes their complementary\naffordances. We propose a three-layer instructional framework that combines the\nscalability of MOOCs, the responsiveness of Smart Teaching, and the adaptivity\nof AI. To demonstrate its feasibility, we present a curriculum design for a\nproject-based course. The findings highlight the framework's potential to\nenhance learner engagement, support instructors, and enable personalized yet\nscalable learning.",

To\naddress these challenges, we introduce the DFT-based Research Engine for\nAgentic Materials Screening (DREAMS), a hierarchical, multi-agent framework for\nDFT simulation that combines a central Large Language Model (LLM) planner agent\nwith domain-specific LLM agents for atomistic structure generation, systematic\nDFT convergence testing, High-Performance Computing (HPC) scheduling, and error\nhandling. In addition, a shared canvas helps the LLM agents to structure their\ndiscussions, preserve context and prevent hallucination. We validate DREAMS\ncapabilities on the Sol27LC lattice-constant benchmark, achieving average\nerrors below 1\\% compared to the results of human DFT experts. Furthermore, we\napply DREAMS to the long-standing CO/Pt(111) adsorption puzzle, demonstrating\nits long-term and complex problem-solving capabilities. The framework again\nreproduces expert-level literature adsorption-energy differences. Finally,\nDREAMS is employed to quantify functional-driven uncertainties with Bayesian\nensemble sampling, confirming the Face Centered Cubic (FCC)-site preference at\nthe Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) DFT level. In conclusion, DREAMS\napproaches L3-level automation - autonomous exploration of a defined design\nspace - and significantly reduces the reliance on human expertise and\nintervention, offering a scalable path toward democratized, high-throughput,\nhigh-fidelity computational materials discovery.",

This situation underscores an urgent need\nfor effective safety measures, akin to access controls for human users. To\naddress this critical challenge, we introduce WebGuard, the first comprehensive\ndataset designed to support the assessment of web agent action risks and\nfacilitate the development of guardrails for real-world online environments. In\ndoing so, WebGuard specifically focuses on predicting the outcome of\nstate-changing actions and contains 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193\nwebsites across 22 diverse domains, including often-overlooked long-tail\nwebsites. These actions are categorized using a novel three-tier risk schema:\nSAFE, LOW, and HIGH. The dataset includes designated training and test splits\nto support evaluation under diverse generalization settings. Our initial\nevaluations reveal a concerning deficiency: even frontier LLMs achieve less\nthan 60% accuracy in predicting action outcomes and less than 60% recall in\nlagging HIGH-risk actions, highlighting the risks of deploying\ncurrent-generation agents without dedicated safeguards. We therefore\ninvestigate fine-tuning specialized guardrail models using WebGuard. We conduct\ncomprehensive evaluations across multiple generalization settings and find that\na fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-7B model yields a substantial improvement in\nperformance, boosting accuracy from 37% to 80% and HIGH-risk action recall from\n20% to 76%. Despite these improvements, the performance still falls short of\nthe reliability required for high-stakes deployment, where guardrails must\napproach near-perfect accuracy and recall.",

Existing\nReinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a\nsingle-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models\ntrained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems\nacross multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual\nfeedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect\ntheir answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training\nmodels with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., \"Let's try again\")\nafter wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn\nreasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement\nlearning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative\nproblem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training\nsetups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn\nperformance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling\nlanguage models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To\nfurther minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while\nencouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures\nthat guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

To address this, we propose an Age\nof Information (AoI)-centric UAV-ISAC system that simultaneously performs\ntarget sensing and serves multiple ground users, emphasizing information\nfreshness as the core performance metric. We formulate a long-term average AoI\nminimization problem that jointly optimizes the UAV's flight trajectory and\nbeamforming. To tackle the high-dimensional, non-convexity of this problem, we\ndevelop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm capable of\nproviding real-time decisions on UAV movement and beamforming for both radar\nsensing and multi-user communication. Specifically, a Kalman filter is employed\nfor accurate target state prediction, regularized zero-forcing is utilized to\nmitigate inter-user interference, and the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm is\napplied for training the DRL agent on continuous actions. The proposed\nframework adaptively balances the trade-offs between sensing accuracy and\ncommunication quality. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our\nproposed method consistently achieves lower average AoI compared to baseline\napproaches.",

      "abstract": "The widespread deployment of cameras has led to an exponential increase in\nvideo data, creating vast opportunities for applications such as traffic\nmanagement and crime surveillance. However, querying specific objects from\nlarge-scale video datasets presents challenges, including (1) processing\nmassive and continuously growing data volumes, (2) supporting complex query\nrequirements, and (3) ensuring low-latency execution. Existing video analysis\nmethods struggle with either limited adaptability to unseen object classes or\nsuffer from high query latency. In this paper, we present LOVO, a novel system\ndesigned to efficiently handle comp$\\underline{L}$ex $\\underline{O}$bject\nqueries in large-scale $\\underline{V}$ide$\\underline{O}$ datasets. Agnostic to\nuser queries, LOVO performs one-time feature extraction using pre-trained\nvisual encoders, generating compact visual embeddings for key frames to build\nan efficient index. These visual embeddings, along with associated bounding\nboxes, are organized in an inverted multi-index structure within a vector\ndatabase, which supports queries for any objects. During the query phase, LOVO\ntransforms object queries to query embeddings and conducts fast approximate\nnearest-neighbor searches on the visual embeddings. Finally, a cross-modal\nrerank is performed to refine the results by fusing visual features with\ndetailed textual features. Evaluation on real-world video datasets demonstrates\nthat LOVO outperforms existing methods in handling complex queries, with\nnear-optimal query accuracy and up to 85x lower search latency, while\nsignificantly reducing index construction costs. This system redefines the\nstate-of-the-art object query approaches in video analysis, setting a new\nbenchmark for complex object queries with a novel, scalable, and efficient\napproach that excels in dynamic environments.",

The need\nfor human expertise in specific areas may no longer be needed because machines\nhave achieved successful results using artificial intelligence and can make the\nright decisions in critical situations. This process is possible with the help\nof deep learning (DL), one of the most popular artificial intelligence\ntechnologies. One of the areas in which the use of DL is used is in the\ndevelopment of self-driving cars, which is very effective and important. In\nthis work, we propose several efficient models to investigate scene\nunderstanding through semantic segmentation. We use the BDD100k dataset to\ninvestigate these models. Another contribution of this work is the usage of\nseveral Backbones as encoders for models. The obtained results show that\nchoosing the appropriate backbone has a great effect on the performance of the\nmodel for semantic segmentation. Better performance in semantic segmentation\nallows us to understand better the scene and the environment around the agent.\nIn the end, we analyze and evaluate the proposed models in terms of accuracy,\nmean IoU, and loss function, and the results show that these metrics are\nimproved.",

A self-supervised learning framework was\ndeveloped, where each blade of the PROPELLER acquisition was split along the\nreadout direction into two partitions. One subset trains the unrolled\nreconstruction network, while the other subset is used for loss calculation,\nenabling self-supervised training without clean targets and leveraging matched\nnoise statistics for denoising. For comparison, Marchenko-Pastur Principal\nComponent Analysis (MPPCA) was performed along the coil dimension, followed by\nconventional parallel imaging reconstruction. The quality of the reconstructed\nlung MRI was assessed visually by two experienced radiologists independently.\n  Results: The proposed self-supervised model improved the clarity and\nstructural integrity of the lung images. For cases with available CT scans, the\nreconstructed images demonstrated strong alignment with corresponding CT\nimages. Additionally, the proposed model enables further scan time reduction by\nrequiring only half the number of blades. Reader evaluations confirmed that the\nproposed method outperformed MPPCA-denoised images across all categories\n(Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p<0.001), with moderate inter-reader agreement\n(weighted Cohen's kappa=0.55; percentage of exact and within +/-1 point\nagreement=91%).\n  Conclusion: By leveraging intrinsic structural redundancies between two\ndisjoint splits of k-space subsets, the proposed self-supervised learning model\neffectively reconstructs the image while suppressing the noise for 0.55T\nT2-weighted lung MRI with PROPELLER sampling.",

      "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities\nbut often fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation\n(TTA) allows models to update at inference time without labeled data, typically\nvia entropy minimization. However, this objective is fundamentally misaligned\nwith the contrastive image-text training of VLMs, limiting adaptation\nperformance and introducing failure modes such as pseudo-label drift and class\ncollapse. We propose CLIPTTA, a new gradient-based TTA method for\nvision-language models that leverages a soft contrastive loss aligned with\nCLIP's pre-training objective. We provide a theoretical analysis of CLIPTTA's\ngradients, showing how its batch-aware design mitigates the risk of collapse.\nWe further extend CLIPTTA to the open-set setting, where both in-distribution\n(ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are encountered, using an Outlier\nContrastive Exposure (OCE) loss to improve OOD detection. Evaluated on 75\ndatasets spanning diverse distribution shifts, CLIPTTA consistently outperforms\nentropy-based objectives and is highly competitive with state-of-the-art TTA\nmethods, outperforming them on a large number of datasets and exhibiting more\nstable performance across diverse shifts.",

While existing methods have made notable progress, they often\noverlook a hidden stumbling block in GCD: distracted attention. Specifically,\nwhen processing unlabeled data, models tend to focus not only on key objects in\nthe image but also on task-irrelevant background regions, leading to suboptimal\nfeature extraction. To remove this stumbling block, we propose Attention\nFocusing (AF), an adaptive mechanism designed to sharpen the model's focus by\npruning non-informative tokens. AF consists of two simple yet effective\ncomponents: Token Importance Measurement (TIME) and Token Adaptive Pruning\n(TAP), working in a cascade. TIME quantifies token importance across multiple\nscales, while TAP prunes non-informative tokens by utilizing the multi-scale\nimportance scores provided by TIME. AF is a lightweight, plug-and-play module\nthat integrates seamlessly into existing GCD methods with minimal computational\noverhead. When incorporated into one prominent GCD method, SimGCD, AF achieves\nup to 15.4% performance improvement over the baseline with minimal\ncomputational overhead.

      "abstract": "Recommender systems are known to exhibit fairness issues, particularly on the\nproduct side, where products and their associated suppliers receive unequal\nexposure in recommended results. While this problem has been widely studied in\ntraditional recommendation settings, its implications for bundle recommendation\n(BR) remain largely unexplored. This emerging task introduces additional\ncomplexity: recommendations are generated at the bundle level, yet user\nsatisfaction and product (or supplier) exposure depend on both the bundle and\nthe individual items it contains. Existing fairness frameworks and metrics\ndesigned for traditional recommender systems may not directly translate to this\nmulti-layered setting. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive\nreproducibility study of product-side fairness in BR across three real-world\ndatasets using four state-of-the-art BR methods. We analyze exposure\ndisparities at both the bundle and item levels using multiple fairness metrics,\nuncovering important patterns. Our results show that exposure patterns differ\nnotably between bundles and items, revealing the need for fairness\ninterventions that go beyond bundle-level assumptions. We also find that\nfairness assessments vary considerably depending on the metric used,\nreinforcing the need for multi-faceted evaluation. Furthermore, user behavior\nplays a critical role: when users interact more frequently with bundles than\nwith individual items, BR systems tend to yield fairer exposure distributions\nacross both levels. Overall, our findings offer actionable insights for\nbuilding fairer bundle recommender systems and establish a vital foundation for\nfuture research in this emerging domain.",

      "abstract": "Parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT) is a versatile and extensible approach\nfor adapting a Large Language Model (LLM) for newer tasks. One of the most\nprominent PEFT approaches, Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), primarily focuses on\nadjusting the attention weight matrices within individual decoder blocks of a\nGenerative Pre trained Transformer (GPT2). In contrast, we introduce Solo\nConnection a novel method that adapts the representation at the decoder-block\nlevel rather than modifying individual weight matrices. Not only does Solo\nConnection outperform LoRA on E2E natural language generation benchmarks, but\nit also reduces the number of trainable parameters by 59% relative to LoRA and\nby more than 99% compared to full fine-tuning of GPT2, an early version of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). Solo Connection is also motivated by homotopy\ntheory: we introduce a trainable linear transformation that gradually\ninterpolates between a zero vector and the task-specific representation,\nenabling smooth and stable adaptation over time. While skip connections in the\noriginal 12 layer GPT2 are typically confined to individual decoder blocks,\nsubsequent GPT2 variants scale up to 48 layers, and even larger language models\ncan include 128 or more decoder blocks. These expanded architectures underscore\nthe need to revisit how skip connections are employed during fine-tuning. This\npaper focuses on long skip connections that link outputs of different decoder\nblocks, potentially enhancing the model's ability to adapt to new tasks while\nleveraging pre-trained knowledge.",

In this work, we focus on measuring, analyzing, and mitigating\nthese artifacts (i.e., \"hallucinations\"). We observe that hallucinations are\nnot well-characterized with existing image metrics or quality models, as they\nare orthogonal to both exact fidelity and no-reference quality. Instead, we\ntake advantage of a multimodal large language model (MLLM) by constructing a\nprompt that assesses hallucinatory visual elements and generates a\n\"Hallucination Score\" (HS). We find that our HS is closely aligned with human\nevaluations, and also provides complementary insights to prior image metrics\nused for super-resolution (SR) models. In addition, we find certain deep\nfeature distances have strong correlations with HS.

      "abstract": "Ultrasound technology enables safe, non-invasive imaging of dynamic tissue\nbehavior, making it a valuable tool in medicine, biomechanics, and sports\nscience. However, accurately tracking tissue motion in B-mode ultrasound\nremains challenging due to speckle noise, low edge contrast, and out-of-plane\nmovement. These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks\nover time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical\nand research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning\nand optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated\nframework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine\ndeep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking\nacross diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes\na graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality\ntraining data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a\nnovel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency\nframe-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack\ndemonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point\ntrackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its\npotential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical\nresearch. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:\ncardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis\nduring reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion. As an\nopen-source solution, DUSTrack offers a powerful, flexible framework for point\ntracking to quantify tissue motion from ultrasound videos.

Current literature suggests that reintroducing\ntopological information using persistent homology can improve medical\ndiagnostics; however, previous methods utilize global topological summaries\nwhich do not contain information about the locality of topological features. To\naddress this gap, we present a novel method that generates local persistent\nhomology-based data using a modified version of the convolution operator called\nPersistent Homology Convolutions. This method captures information about the\nlocality and translation invariance of topological features. We perform a\ncomparative study using various representations of histopathology slides and\nfind that models trained with persistent homology convolutions outperform\nconventionally trained models and are less sensitive to hyperparameters. These\nresults indicate that persistent homology convolutions extract meaningful\ngeometric information from the histopathology slides.",

      "abstract": "The escalating threat of cyberattacks on real-time critical infrastructures\nposes serious risks to public safety, demanding detection methods that\neffectively capture complex system interdependencies and adapt to evolving\nattack patterns. Traditional real-time anomaly detection techniques often\nsuffer from excessive false positives due to their statistical sensitivity to\nhigh data variance and class imbalance. To address these limitations, recent\nresearch has explored modeling causal relationships among system components.\nHowever, prior work mainly focuses on offline causal graph-based approaches\nthat require static historical data and fail to generalize to real-time\nsettings. These methods are fundamentally constrained by: (1) their inability\nto adapt to dynamic shifts in data distribution without retraining, and (2) the\nrisk of catastrophic forgetting when lacking timely supervision in live\nsystems. To overcome these challenges, we propose INCADET, a novel framework\nfor incremental causal graph learning tailored to real-time cyberattack\ndetection. INCADET dynamically captures evolving system behavior by\nincrementally updating causal graphs across streaming time windows. The\nframework comprises three modules: 1) Early Symptom Detection: Detects\ntransitions in system status using divergence in edge-weight distributions\nacross sequential causal graphs. 2) Incremental Causal Graph Learning:\nLeverages experience replay and edge reinforcement to continually refine causal\nstructures while preserving prior knowledge. 3) Causal Graph Classification:\nEmploys Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to classify system status using the\nlearned causal graphs. Extensive experiments on real-world critical\ninfrastructure datasets demonstrate that INCADET achieves superior accuracy,\nrobustness, and adaptability compared to both static causal and deep temporal\nbaselines in evolving attack scenarios.",

However, despite their\nimpressive performance, recent studies have highlighted how current reasoning\nmodels frequently fail to generalize to novel, unseen problems, often resorting\nto memorized solutions rather than genuine inferential reasoning. Such behavior\nunderscores a critical limitation in modern LRMs, i.e., their tendency toward\noverfitting, which in turn results in poor generalization in problem-solving\ncapabilities.\n  In this paper, we introduce Nexus Architect, an enhanced iteration of our\nmulti-agent system framework, Nexus, equipped with a novel automated workflow\nsynthesis mechanism. Given a user's prompt and a small set of representative\nexamples, the Architect autonomously generates a tailored reasoning workflow by\nselecting suitable strategies, tool integrations, and adversarial techniques\nfor a specific problem class. Furthermore, the Architect includes an iterative\nprompt refinement mechanism that fine-tunes agents' system prompts to maximize\nperformance and improve the generalization capabilities of the system.\n  We empirically evaluate Nexus Architect by employing an off-the-shelf,\nnon-reasoning model on a custom dataset of challenging logical questions and\ncompare its performance against state-of-the-art LRMs. Results show that Nexus\nArchitect consistently outperforms existing solutions, achieving up to a 66%\nincrease in pass rate over Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview, nearly 2.5$\\times$ against\nClaude Sonnet 4 and DeepSeek-R1, and over 3$\\times$ w.r.t.

However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive\ndomains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose\ncollaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries\nthe model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty\nof a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an\neffective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3\n235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring\n7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them\nchallenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this\nchallenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning\nmodel. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system \"Fail Fast, or Ask\",\nsince the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert\ndirectly (\"failing fast\"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher\nlatency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and\nabout 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the\naccuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower\nthan expected because of \"latency drag\", the phenomenon that processing easier\nqueries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency\ndistribution towards longer latencies. Broadly, our results suggest that the\ndeficiencies of state-of-the-art reasoning models -- nontrivial error rates and\nhigh latency -- can be substantially mitigated through black-box systems\nengineering, without requiring access to LLM internals.",

      "abstract": "Intelligence-biological, artificial, or collective-requires structural\ncoherence across recursive reasoning processes to scale effectively. As complex\nsystems grow, coherence becomes fragile unless a higher-order structure ensures\nsemantic consistency. This paper introduces the Recursive Coherence Principle\n(RCP): a foundational constraint stating that for any reasoning system of order\nN, composed of systems operating over conceptual spaces of order N-1, semantic\ncoherence is preserved only by a recursively evaluable generalization operator\nthat spans and aligns those lower-order conceptual spaces. Crucially, this\ncoherence enables structural alignment. Without recursive coherence, no system\ncan reliably preserve goals, meanings, or reasoning consistency at scale. We\nformally define the Functional Model of Intelligence (FMI) as the only known\noperator capable of satisfying the RCP at any scale. The FMI is a minimal,\ncomposable architecture with internal functions (evaluation, modeling,\nadaptation, stability, decomposition, bridging) and external functions\n(storage, recall, System 1 and System 2 reasoning) vital for preserving\nsemantic structure across inference and coordination layers. We prove that any\nsystem lacking the FMI will experience recursive coherence breakdown as it\nscales, arguing that common AI issues like misalignment, hallucination, and\ninstability are symptoms of this structural coherence loss. Unlike other\nfoundational principles, RCP uniquely captures the internal, recursive dynamics\nneeded for coherent, alignable intelligence, modeling semantic coherence under\nrecursion. This work significantly impacts AI alignment, advocating a shift\nfrom behavioral constraints to structural coherence, and offers a pathway for\nsafely generalizable, robustly coherent AI at scale.",

      "abstract": "Large language models have paved the way to powerful and flexible AI agents,\nassisting humans by increasingly integrating into their daily life. This\nflexibility, potential, and growing adoption demands a holistic and\ncross-disciplinary approach to developing, monitoring and discussing the\ncapabilities required for agent-driven user experiences. However, current\nguidance on human-centered AI agent development is scattered: UX heuristics\nfocus on interface behaviors, engineering taxonomies describe internal\npipelines, and ethics checklists address high-level governance. There is no\nconcise, user-facing vocabulary that tells teams what an agent should\nfundamentally be able to do. We introduce ADEPTS, a capability framework\ndefining a set of core user-facing capabilities to provide unified guidance\naround the development of AI agents. ADEPTS is based on six principles for\nhuman-centered agent design, that express the minimal, user-facing capabilities\nan AI agent should demonstrate to be understandable, controllable and\ntrustworthy in everyday use. ADEPTS complements existing frameworks and\ntaxonomies; differently from them, it sits at the interface between technical\nand experience development. By presenting ADEPTS, we aim to condense complex\nAI-UX requirements into a compact framework that is actionable guidance for AI\nresearchers, designers, engineers, and policy reviewers alike. We believe\nADEPTS has the potential of accelerating the improvement of user-relevant agent\ncapabilities, of easing the design of experiences that take advantage of those\ncapabilities, and of providing a shared language to track and discuss progress\naround the development of AI agents.",

Within MDD,\nphoneme-level pronunciation assessment is key to helping L2 learners improve\ntheir pronunciation. However, most systems are based on a form of goodness of\npronunciation (GOP) which requires pre-segmentation of speech into phonetic\nunits. This limits the accuracy of these methods and the possibility to use\nmodern CTC-based acoustic models for their evaluation. In this study, we first\npropose self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) that enables the use of CTC-trained ASR\nmodels for MDD. Next, we define a more general alignment-free method that takes\nall possible alignments of the target phoneme into account (GOP-AF). We give a\ntheoretical account of our definition of GOP-AF, an implementation that solves\npotential numerical issues as well as a proper normalization which makes the\nmethod applicable with acoustic models with different peakiness over time. We\nprovide extensive experimental results on the CMU Kids and Speechocean762\ndatasets comparing the different definitions of our methods, estimating the\ndependency of GOP-AF on the peakiness of the acoustic models and on the amount\nof context around the target phoneme. Finally, we compare our methods with\nrecent studies over the Speechocean762 data showing that the feature vectors\nderived from the proposed method achieve state-of-the-art results on\nphoneme-level pronunciation assessment.",

We propose BikeVAE-GNN, a novel dual-task\nframework augmenting a Hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) with Variational\nAutoencoder (VAE) to estimate Average Daily Bicycle (ADB) counts, addressing\nsparse bicycle networks. The Hybrid-GNN combines Graph Convolutional Networks\n(GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE to effectively model\nintricate spatial relationships in sparse networks while VAE generates\nsynthetic nodes and edges to enrich the graph structure and enhance the\nestimation performance. BikeVAE-GNN simultaneously performs - regression for\nbicycling volume estimation and classification for bicycling traffic level\ncategorization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BikeVAE-GNN using\nOpenStreetMap data and publicly available bicycle count data within the City of\nMelbourne - where only 141 of 15,933 road segments have labeled counts\n(resulting in 99% count data sparsity). Our experiments show that BikeVAE-GNN\noutperforms machine learning and baseline GNN models, achieving a mean absolute\nerror (MAE) of 30.82 bicycles per day, accuracy of 99% and F1-score of 0.99.\nAblation studies further validate the effective role of Hybrid-GNN and VAE\ncomponents.

      "abstract": "Subgraph matching plays an important role in electronic design automation\n(EDA) and circuit verification. Traditional rule-based methods have limitations\nin generalizing to arbitrary target circuits. Furthermore, node-to-node\nmatching approaches tend to be computationally inefficient, particularly for\nlarge-scale circuits. Deep learning methods have emerged as a potential\nsolution to address these challenges, but existing models fail to efficiently\ncapture global subgraph embeddings or rely on inefficient matching matrices,\nwhich limits their effectiveness for large circuits. In this paper, we propose\nan efficient graph matching approach that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nto predict regions of high probability for containing the target circuit.\nSpecifically, we construct various negative samples to enable GNNs to\naccurately learn the presence of target circuits and develop an approach to\ndirectly extracting subgraph embeddings from the entire circuit, which captures\nglobal subgraph information and addresses the inefficiency of applying GNNs to\nall candidate subgraphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods in terms of time efficiency and\ntarget region prediction, offering a scalable and effective solution for\nsubgraph matching in large-scale circuits.",

      "abstract": "Data used for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are\nexpensive and often impractical to obtain, particularly labelled data.\nPopulation-based SHM presents a potential solution to this issue by considering\nthe available data across a population of structures. However, differences\nbetween structures will mean the training and testing distributions will\ndiffer; thus, conventional machine learning methods cannot be expected to\ngeneralise between structures. To address this issue, transfer learning (TL),\ncan be used to leverage information across related domains. An important\nconsideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based\nmetrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions.\nThus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is\nto identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for\nwhich the conditional distributions are related to the target structure.\nGenerally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain\nexpertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on\nthe dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial. In this paper,\nknowledge of physics is leveraged to select more similar features, the modal\nassurance criterion (MAC) is used to quantify the correspondence between the\nmodes of healthy structures. The MAC is shown to have high correspondence with\na supervised metric that measures joint-distribution similarity, which is the\nprimary indicator of whether a classifier will generalise between domains. The\nMAC is proposed as a measure for selecting a set of features that behave\nconsistently across domains when subjected to damage, i.e. features with\ninvariance in the conditional distributions. This approach is demonstrated on\nnumerical and experimental case studies to verify its effectiveness in various\napplications.",

The ML models\nthat are examined in this study include logistic regression, k-nearest\nneighbors, and random forest. The dataset on which the models train and predict\nis acquired from NASA's Kepler space telescope. The initial results show\npromising scores for each model. However, potential biases and dataset\nimbalances necessitate the use of data augmentation techniques to further\nensure fairer predictions and improved generalization.

Additionally, users can interactively query generated\nvisualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration. Reliability and\nreproducibility are further strengthened by Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG), providing context-driven responses while maintaining comprehensive\nprovenance records. Evaluations on complex volumetric datasets demonstrate\nsignificant reductions in cognitive overhead for iterative visualization tasks.\nBy integrating curated domain-specific tools with LLM-driven flexibility,\nVizGenie not only accelerates insight generation but also establishes a\nsustainable, continuously evolving visualization practice.

However, this came at a\nsignificantly higher computational cost: 50GB VRAM and $1.61/hour versus 5GB\nand $0.16/hour for Mistral 7B. Our findings provide practical insights into the\ntrade-offs between model quality and resource efficiency, offering guidance for\ndeploying LLMs in production environments and demonstrating their effectiveness\nin enhancing the consistency and reliability of accommodation data.",

However, existing internet infrastructure is primarily designed for human\ninteraction, creating data silos, unfriendly interfaces, and high collaboration\ncosts among agents, making it difficult to support the needs for large-scale\nagent interconnection and collaboration. The internet is undergoing a profound\ntransformation, showing four core trends: agents replacing traditional\nsoftware, universal agent interconnection, native protocol-based connections,\nand autonomous agent organization and collaboration. To align with these\ntrends, Agent Network Protocol (ANP) proposes a new generation of communication\nprotocols for the Agentic Web. ANP adheres to AI-native design, maintains\ncompatibility with existing internet protocols, adopts a modular composable\narchitecture, follows minimalist yet extensible principles, and enables rapid\ndeployment based on existing infrastructure. Through a three-layer protocol\nsystem--identity and encrypted communication layer, meta-protocol negotiation\nlayer, and application protocol layer--ANP. systematically solves the problems\nof agent identity authentication, dynamic negotiation, and capability discovery\ninteroperability.",
