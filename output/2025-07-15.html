      "abstract": "Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a dominant strategy for\nself-supervised representation learning in natural images, where models are\npre-trained to reconstruct masked patches with a pixel-wise mean squared error\n(MSE) between original and reconstructed RGB values as the loss. We observe\nthat MSE encourages blurred image re-construction, but still works for natural\nimages as it preserves dominant edges. However, in medical imaging, when the\ntexture cues are more important for classification of a visual abnormality, the\nstrategy fails. Taking inspiration from Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)\nfeature in Radiomics studies, we propose a novel MAE based pre-training\nframework, GLCM-MAE, using reconstruction loss based on matching GLCM. GLCM\ncaptures intensity and spatial relationships in an image, hence proposed loss\nhelps preserve morphological features. Further, we propose a novel formulation\nto convert matching GLCM matrices into a differentiable loss function. We\ndemonstrate that unsupervised pre-training on medical images with the proposed\nGLCM loss improves representations for downstream tasks. GLCM-MAE outperforms\nthe current state-of-the-art across four tasks - gallbladder cancer detection\nfrom ultrasound images by 2.1%, breast cancer detection from ultrasound by\n3.1%, pneumonia detection from x-rays by 0.5%, and COVID detection from CT by\n0.6%.

To address these\nissues, we present Trexplorer Super, an enhanced version that notably improves\nperformance through novel advancements. However, evaluating centerline tracking\nmodels is challenging due to the lack of public datasets. To enable thorough\nevaluation, we develop three centerline datasets, one synthetic and two real,\neach with increasing difficulty. Using these datasets, we conduct a\ncomprehensive evaluation of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and compare\nthem with our approach. Trexplorer Super outperforms previous SOTA models on\nevery dataset. Our results also highlight that strong performance on synthetic\ndata does not necessarily translate to real datasets.

In this study, we introduce a modernized CNN-based model for\nglobal weather forecasting that delivers competitive accuracy while\nsignificantly reducing computational requirements. To present a systematic\nmodernization roadmap, we highlight key architectural enhancements across\nmultiple design scales from an earlier CNN-based approach.

Our evaluation shows that KAI-a matches the\nperformance of state-of-the-art models in medium-range weather forecasting,\nwhile offering a significantly lightweight design.

Its modular\narchitecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while\nthe explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy\nof instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting\nadaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training.\nComplementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive\nannotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on\nthree dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic\ndiversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction\nquality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on\nexpert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from\nspecific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable\nresearch.

Performance is assessed using five distinct\nmetrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency.\nResults consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art\nbaselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled\ntrade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label\ninconsistency. Notably, LVL achieves the best aggregate rank across all\nbenchmarked backbones and metrics, while LGCL frequently ranks the second,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of our framework.",

One-shot coreset selection addresses this by pruning\nthe dataset while maintaining or even improving model performance, often\nrelying on training-dynamics-based data difficulty scores. However, most\nexisting methods implicitly assume class-wise homogeneity in data difficulty,\noverlooking variation in data difficulty across different classes.\n  In this work, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such\nas network intrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often\nclusters by class. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and\nintroduce the Class Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a\nquantitative measure. We demonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with\nperformance degradation in class-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to\noverrepresent easy majority classes while neglecting rare but informative ones.\n  To address this, we introduce class-proportional variants of multiple\nsampling strategies. Evaluated on five diverse datasets spanning security and\nmedical domains, our methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art data\nefficiency. For instance, on CTU-13, at an extreme 99% pruning rate, a\nclass-proportional variant of Coverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS-CP) shows\nremarkable stability, with accuracy dropping only 2.58%, precision 0.49%, and\nrecall 0.19%. In contrast, the class-agnostic CCS baseline, the next best\nmethod, suffers sharper declines of 7.59% in accuracy, 4.57% in precision, and\n4.11% in recall.\n  We further show that aggressive pruning enhances generalization in noisy,\nimbalanced, and large-scale datasets.

Instead of deterministically mapping a word to a single Hanja\n(Chinese character), HanjaBridge presents the model with all possible Hanja\ncandidates for a given homograph, encouraging the model to learn contextual\ndisambiguation. This process is paired with token-level knowledge distillation\nto prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that HanjaBridge\nsignificantly improves Korean language understanding, achieving a 21\\% relative\nimprovement on the KoBALT benchmark.

We\nthen compared their outputs to human responses drawn from a dataset covering 53\nnations. Our analysis reveals three main results. First, LLMs generally exhibit\na risk-neutral decision-making pattern, favoring choices aligned with expected\nvalue calculations when faced with lottery-type questions. Second, when\nevaluating trade-offs between present and future, LLMs occasionally produce\nresponses that appear inconsistent with normative reasoning. Third, when we\nexamine cross-national similarities, we find that the LLMs' aggregate responses\nmost closely resemble those of participants from Tanzania. These findings\ncontribute to the understanding of how LLMs emulate human-like decision\nbehaviors and highlight potential cultural and training influences embedded\nwithin their outputs.",

Existing methods often rely on\nfully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations.\nIn this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self\ndistillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View\n(FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view\nlocalization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,\nwhile the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart\ncreated by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those\nof the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores\ntextureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions\nand reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas\nor limited FoV images. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly\nimproves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we\nintroduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative\norientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth. GeoDistill\nprovides a scalable and efficient solution for real-world cross-view\nlocalization challenges. Code and model can be found at\nhttps://github.com/tongshw/GeoDistill.",

Scaling the BPU via structured connectome\nexpansions further improves CIFAR-10 performance, while modality-specific\nablations reveal the uneven contributions of different sensory subsystems. On\nthe ChessBench dataset, a lightweight GNN-BPU model trained on only 10,000\ngames achieves 60% move accuracy, nearly 10x better than any size transformer.\nMoreover, CNN-BPU models with ~2M parameters outperform parameter-matched\nTransformers, and with a depth-6 minimax search at inference, reach 91.7%\naccuracy, exceeding even a 9M-parameter Transformer baseline.

How well do these models\nalign with human performance in detecting and mapping analogies? Prior research\nhas shown that LLMs can extract similarities from analogy problems but lack\nrobust human-like reasoning. Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the\ncurrent study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a\nfine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human\nperformance. First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in\nLLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity\nbetween the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity\nbetween the source and distractor texts. Second, it investigated the\neffectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies. Throughout, we\nexamine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in\nhumans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and\nnot just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done). Our\nexperiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters)\nand performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as\nGPT-4 and LLaMA3. This work advances our understanding of the analogical\nreasoning abilities of LLMs and their potential as models of human reasoning.",

We evaluate our approach on the challenging Gait3D, GREW and BRIAR\ndatasets and show that learning the residual can be an effective technique to\ntackle occluded gait recognition with holistic retention.

Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual\nsimilarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it\ndifficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional\ngradient-based methods prioritise $\\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing\nadversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions, making\nthem detectable. We propose a latent space perturbation framework using a\nmixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate imperceptible adversarial\nexamples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical\nfeatures into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve\nstatistical consistency. We specify In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to\nmeasure the proportion of adversarial examples that remain statistically\nindistinguishable from the input distribution. Evaluation across six publicly\navailable datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method\nachieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance\ncompared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted\nfrom image domain approaches. Our comprehensive analysis includes\nhyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control mechanisms, and generative\narchitectural comparisons, revealing that VAE-based attacks depend critically\non reconstruction quality but offer superior practical utility when sufficient\ntraining data is available. This work highlights the importance of on-manifold\nperturbations for realistic adversarial attacks on tabular data, offering a\nrobust approach for practical deployment.

However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a\nsimplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural\nrepresentations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin\nto those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information\nredundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive\nperformance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight\narchitectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information\nprocessing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled\nby kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order\nspatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further\nmodulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise\nredundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently\ngather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental\nresults in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable\nparameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular,\non the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M\nparameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver\nstrong performance through an efficient design. On the COCO benchmark, it\nachieves 50.0% AP, surpassing the previous benchmark by 1.2% with only 21.5M\nparameters. The code is publicly available at\n[https://github.com/henry-pay/SpaRTAN].",

In these unstructured settings, conventional navigation systems that\nrely on fixed parameters often fail to generalize across scenarios, resulting\nin degraded performance and reduced social acceptance. Although recent\napproaches have leveraged reinforcement learning to enhance traditional\nplanners, these methods often fail in real-world deployments due to poor\ngeneralization and limited simulation diversity, which hampers effective\nsim-to-real transfer. To tackle these issues, we present LE-Nav, an\ninterpretable and scene-aware navigation framework that leverages multi-modal\nlarge language model reasoning and conditional variational autoencoders to\nadaptively tune planner hyperparameters. To achieve zero-shot scene\nunderstanding, we utilize one-shot exemplars and chain-of-thought prompting\nstrategies. Additionally, a conditional variational autoencoder captures the\nmapping between natural language instructions and navigation hyperparameters,\nenabling expert-level tuning. Experiments show that LE-Nav can generate\nhyperparameters achieving human-level tuning across diverse planners and\nscenarios. Real-world navigation trials and a user study on a smart wheelchair\nplatform demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on\nquantitative metrics such as success rate, efficiency, safety, and comfort,\nwhile receiving higher subjective scores for perceived safety and social\nacceptance.

Then, SISRNet systematically focuses on\nthese high-information regions during both image modeling and report\ngeneration, effectively capturing subtle abnormal findings, mitigating the\nnegative impact of data bias, and ultimately generating clinically accurate\nreports.

      "abstract": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing\nlarge language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and\ncomputational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods\noften rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,\nunder the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained\nfull-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation\nprocess introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights\nand their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally\nflawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly\nincorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error\ncompensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference\nbetween latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited\ngeneralization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach\nintroduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages\nprecomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian\nsubmatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models\nand benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical\nGPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of\nLlama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from\n51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.\nFurthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as\nGPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging\nW4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision\nbaselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve.

      "abstract": "Transformer-based models exhibit strong global modeling capabilities in\nsingle-image dehazing, but their high computational cost limits real-time\napplicability. Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features\nto capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and\noften inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce\nfrequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches\nlimits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the\nDark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel\ndual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment\nacross spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two\nkey modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a\npixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance\nhaze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware\nspectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which\nfuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid\ngating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior\nCorrection Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback\nmechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed\nfeatures and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in\nchallenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze\ndatasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with\nsuperior robustness and real-time efficiency.

To address\nthis, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46\nsubjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system. Each frame includes a\ncomplete 5-view reconstruction of the foot and ankle (serving as ground truth)\nalong with partial point clouds obtained from only four, three, or two views.\nThis structured variation enables rigorous evaluation of 3D point cloud\ncompletion methods under varying occlusion levels and viewpoints.

      "abstract": "Accurate indoor localization is crucial for enabling spatial context in smart\nenvironments and navigation systems. Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS)\nfingerprinting is a widely used indoor localization approach due to its\ncompatibility with mobile embedded devices. Deep Learning (DL) models improve\naccuracy in localization tasks by learning RSS variations across locations, but\nthey assume fingerprint vectors exist in a Euclidean space, failing to\nincorporate spatial relationships and the non-uniform distribution of\nreal-world RSS noise. This results in poor generalization across heterogeneous\nmobile devices, where variations in hardware and signal processing distort RSS\nreadings. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can improve upon conventional DL models\nby encoding indoor locations as nodes and modeling their spatial and signal\nrelationships as edges. However, GNNs struggle with non-Euclidean noise\ndistributions and suffer from the GNN blind spot problem, leading to degraded\naccuracy in environments with dense access points (APs). To address these\nchallenges, we propose GATE, a novel framework that constructs an adaptive\ngraph representation of fingerprint vectors while preserving an indoor\nstate-space topology, modeling the non-Euclidean structure of RSS noise to\nmitigate environmental noise and address device heterogeneity. GATE introduces\n1) a novel Attention Hyperspace Vector (AHV) for enhanced message passing, 2) a\nnovel Multi-Dimensional Hyperspace Vector (MDHV) to mitigate the GNN blind\nspot, and 3) an new Real-Time Edge Construction (RTEC) approach for dynamic\ngraph adaptation. Extensive real-world evaluations across multiple indoor\nspaces with varying path lengths, AP densities, and heterogeneous devices\ndemonstrate that GATE achieves 1.6x to 4.72x lower mean localization errors and\n1.85x to 4.57x lower worst-case errors compared to state-of-the-art indoor\nlocalization frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Medical language-guided segmentation, integrating textual clinical reports as\nauxiliary guidance to enhance image segmentation, has demonstrated significant\nimprovements over unimodal approaches. However, its inherent reliance on paired\nimage-text input, which we refer to as ``textual reliance\", presents two\nfundamental limitations: 1) many medical segmentation datasets lack paired\nreports, leaving a substantial portion of image-only data underutilized for\ntraining; and 2) inference is limited to retrospective analysis of cases with\npaired reports, limiting its applicability in most clinical scenarios where\nsegmentation typically precedes reporting. To address these limitations, we\npropose ProLearn, the first Prototype-driven Learning framework for\nlanguage-guided segmentation that fundamentally alleviates textual reliance. At\nits core, we introduce a novel Prototype-driven Semantic Approximation (PSA)\nmodule to enable approximation of semantic guidance from textual input. PSA\ninitializes a discrete and compact prototype space by distilling\nsegmentation-relevant semantics from textual reports. Once initialized, it\nsupports a query-and-respond mechanism which approximates semantic guidance for\nimages without textual input, thereby alleviating textual reliance. Extensive\nexperiments on QaTa-COV19, MosMedData+ and Kvasir-SEG demonstrate that ProLearn\noutperforms state-of-the-art language-guided methods when limited text is\navailable.",

To address this, our ExRec presents\nan end-to-end pipeline, from annotating the KCs of questions and learning their\nsemantic representations to training KT models and optimizing several\nreinforcement learning (RL) methods. Moreover, we improve standard\nQ-learning-based continuous RL methods via a tailored model-based value\nestimation (MVE) approach that directly leverages the components of KT model in\nestimating cumulative knowledge improvement. We validate the effectiveness of\nour ExRec using various RL methods across four real-world tasks with different\neducational goals in online math learning. We further show that ExRec\ngeneralizes robustly to new, unseen questions and that it produces\ninterpretable student learning trajectories.

However,\nachieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian\nSplatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently\nambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these\nlimitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that\nenables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a\nrobust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction\n(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model\nview-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and\nconsistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a\nregularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional\nregularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled\nLatent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality\npart-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region\nwhile preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as\nGaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond\nthe existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local\n3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects\nqualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and\nflexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

      "abstract": "Understanding the 3D geometry of transparent objects from RGB images is\nchallenging due to their inherent physical properties, such as reflection and\nrefraction. To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse\nviews and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian\nSplatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key\ninsight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling\nfocused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate\nartifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions,\nensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting.\nFurthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the\nreconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and\nchain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning.\nTRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it\nconsistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based\nstate-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean\nabsolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore,\ndespite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\\delta} < 2.5 cm\naccuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.\nCode and more results are available at https://jeongyun0609.github.io/TRAN-D/.",

To this end, we propose a graph-based keypoints network for the\nmonocular pose estimation of non-cooperative spacecraft, GKNet, which leverages\nthe geometric constraint of keypoints graph. In order to better validate\nkeypoint detectors, we present a moderate-scale dataset for the spacecraft\nkeypoint detection, named SKD, which consists of 3 spacecraft targets, 90,000\nsimulated images, and corresponding high-precise keypoint annotations.\nExtensive experiments and an ablation study have demonstrated the high accuracy\nand effectiveness of our GKNet, compared to the state-of-the-art spacecraft\nkeypoint detectors.

In this work, we propose F2STrans, a\nfunction-to-style guiding paradigm designed to progressively improve the\nperformance of LLMs in code translation. Our approach comprises two key stages:\n(1) Functional learning, which optimizes translation correctness using\nhigh-quality source-target code pairs mined from online programming platforms,\nand (2) Style learning, which improves translation readability by incorporating\nboth positive and negative style examples. Additionally, we introduce a novel\ncode translation benchmark that includes up-to-date source code, extensive test\ncases, and manually annotated ground-truth translations, enabling comprehensive\nfunctional and stylistic evaluations. Experiments on both our new benchmark and\nexisting datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves code\ntranslation performance. Notably, our approach enables Qwen-1.5B to outperform\nprompt-enhanced Qwen-32B and GPT-4 on average across 20 diverse code\ntranslation scenarios.",

However, these\nmodels often struggle with capturing fine-grained semantic information, such as\nthe precise identification and analysis of object keypoints. Keypoints, as\nstructure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects,\nparticularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as\nfine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition. In\nthis paper, we propose KptLLM++, a novel multimodal large language model that\nspecifically designed for generic keypoint comprehension through the\nintegration of diverse input modalities guided by user-defined instructions. By\nunifying keypoint detection across varied contexts, KptLLM++ establishes itself\nas an advanced interface, fostering more effective human-AI collaboration. The\nmodel is built upon a novel identify-then-detect paradigm, which first\ninterprets keypoint semantics and subsequently localizes their precise\npositions through a structured chain-of-thought reasoning mechanism. To push\nthe boundaries of performance, we have scaled up the training dataset to over\n500K samples, encompassing diverse objects, keypoint categories, image styles,\nand scenarios with complex occlusions. This extensive scaling enables KptLLM++\nto unlock its potential, achieving remarkable accuracy and generalization.\nComprehensive experiments on multiple keypoint detection benchmarks demonstrate\nits state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its potential as a unified\nsolution for fine-grained image understanding and its transformative\nimplications for human-AI interaction.",

We present\nGoldMine OS, a research oriented architecture that employs multiple specialized\nAI agents to automate and secure the tokenization and exchange of physical gold\ninto a blockchain based stablecoin (\"OZ\"). Our approach combines on chain smart\ncontracts for critical risk controls with off chain AI agents for decision\nmaking, blending the transparency and reliability of blockchains with the\nflexibility of AI driven automation. We describe four cooperative agents\n(Compliance, Token Issuance, Market Making, and Risk Control) and a\ncoordinating core, and evaluate the system through simulation and a controlled\npilot deployment. In experiments the prototype delivers on demand token\nissuance in under 1.2 s, more than 100 times faster than manual workflows. The\nMarket Making agent maintains tight liquidity with spreads often below 0.5\npercent even under volatile conditions. Fault injection tests show resilience:\nan oracle price spoofing attack is detected and mitigated within 10 s, and a\nsimulated vault mis reporting halts issuance immediately with minimal user\nimpact. The architecture scales to 5000 transactions per second with 10000\nconcurrent users in benchmarks. These results indicate that an AI agent based\ndecentralized exchange for alternative assets can satisfy rigorous performance\nand safety requirements. We discuss broader implications for democratizing\naccess to traditionally illiquid assets and explain how our governance model --\nmulti signature agent updates and on chain community voting on risk parameters\n-- provides ongoing transparency, adaptability, and formal assurance of system\nintegrity.",

      "abstract": "Hard samples pose a significant challenge in person re-identification (ReID)\ntasks, particularly in clothing-changing person Re-ID (CC-ReID). Their inherent\nambiguity or similarity, coupled with the lack of explicit definitions, makes\nthem a fundamental bottleneck. These issues not only limit the design of\ntargeted learning strategies but also diminish the model's robustness under\nclothing or viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which\nis the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly\ndefine, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL\ncomprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation\n(DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent\nsamples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives\nfor effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2)\nHard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware\noptimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic\nlabels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives\ncloser in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability\nand robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the\npotential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust\nCC-ReID. Notably, HSAL significantly accelerates the convergence of the\ntargeted learning procedure and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both\nPRCC and LTCC datasets.

To address\nthese challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple\nmodalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional\nmodalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality\nindicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality.\nAdditionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate\nmulti-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality\ndifferences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by\ndisentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific\ncomponents, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene\nrepresentation.

We evaluated our\nproposed model on three different benchmark datasets of LandSlide4Sense, Bijie,\nand Nepal. By conducting extensive experiments, we achieve F1 scores of 98.23,\n93.83 for the landslide detection task on LandSlide4Sense, Bijie datasets; mIoU\nscores of 63.74, 76.88 on the segmentation tasks regarding LandSlide4Sense,\nNepal datasets.

This delay is\ncrucial because it represents the time required to perform a computation: in an\nArithmetic-Logic Unit it represents the maximum time taken by the circuit to\nperform an arithmetic operation. When such a circuit is part of a larger,\nsynchronous system, like a CPU, the maximum delay directly impacts the maximum\nclock frequency of the entire system. Typically, hardware designers use Static\nTiming Analysis to compute an upper bound of the maximum delay because it can\nbe determined in polynomial time. However, relying on this upper bound can lead\nto suboptimal processor speeds, thereby missing performance opportunities. In\nthis work, we tackle the challenging task of computing the actual maximum\ndelay, rather than an approximate value.

      "abstract": "Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely utilized imaging modality in clinical\nsettings. Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D\nspatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant\ntime consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based\non sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from\nresearchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent\nyears, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have\ndemonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.\nNonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent\nrepresentation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT\nmodalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment\nwithin the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent\nLatent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature\ncontrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray\nimages and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental\nresults indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art\ngenerative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the\nLIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing\nthe effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but\ncan also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as\ntext-to-image synthesis. We have made our code publicly available at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLS-DM-50D6/ to facilitate further research\nand applications in other domains.",

However, it is still unclear whether they can recognize\nvarious unsafe concepts when presented in different modalities, such as text\nand images. To address this, we first compile the UnsafeConcepts dataset,\nfeaturing 75 unsafe concepts, i.e., ``Swastika,'' ``Sexual Harassment,'' and\n``Assaults,'' along with associated 1.5K images. We then conduct a systematic\nevaluation of VLMs' perception (concept recognition) and alignment (ethical\nreasoning) capabilities. We assess eight popular VLMs and find that, although\nmost VLMs accurately perceive unsafe concepts, they sometimes mistakenly\nclassify these concepts as safe. We also identify a consistent modality gap\namong open-source VLMs in distinguishing between visual and textual unsafe\nconcepts. To bridge this gap, we introduce a simplified reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based approach using proximal policy optimization (PPO) to strengthen the\nability to identify unsafe concepts from images. Our approach uses reward\nscores based directly on VLM responses, bypassing the need for collecting\nhuman-annotated preference data to train a new reward model. Experimental\nresults show that our approach effectively enhances VLM alignment on images\nwhile preserving general capabilities. It outperforms baselines such as\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). We hope\nour dataset, evaluation findings, and proposed alignment solution contribute to\nthe community's efforts in advancing safe VLMs.",

Accurate disease\ndetection and classification serve as critical prerequisites for implementing\ntargeted control measures. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence,\nparticularly deep learning-based computer vision algorithms, have substantially\ndecreased time and labor requirements while maintaining the accuracy of\ndetection and classification. Nevertheless, these methods predominantly rely on\nmassive, high-quality annotated training examples to attain promising\nperformance. By introducing two key designs: contrasting with cluster centroids\nand a multi-layer contrastive training (MCT) paradigm, this paper proposes a\nnovel clustering-guided self-supervised multi-layer contrastive representation\nlearning (CMCRL) algorithm. The proposed method demonstrates several advantages\nover existing counterparts: (1) optimizing with massive unannotated samples;\n(2) effective adaptation to the symptom similarity across distinct citrus\ndiseases; (3) hierarchical feature representation learning. The proposed method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on the public citrus image set CDD,\noutperforming existing methods by 4.5\\%-30.1\\% accuracy. Remarkably, our method\nnarrows the performance gap with fully supervised counterparts (all samples are\nlabeled). Beyond classification accuracy, our method shows great performance on\nother evaluation metrics (F1 score, precision, and recall), highlighting the\nrobustness against the class imbalance challenge.",

      "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis and treatment principles, established\nthrough centuries of trial-and-error clinical practice, directly maps\npatient-specific symptom patterns to personalised herbal therapies. These\nempirical holistic mapping principles offer valuable strategies to address\nremaining challenges of reductionism methodologies in modern biomedicine.\nHowever, the lack of a quantitative framework and molecular-level evidence has\nlimited their interpretability and reliability. Here, we present an AI\nframework trained on ancient and classical TCM formula records to quantify the\nsymptom pattern-herbal therapy mappings. Interestingly, we find that empirical\nTCM diagnosis and treatment are consistent with the encoding-decoding processes\nin the AI model. This enables us to construct an interpretable TCM embedding\nspace (TCM-ES) using the model's quantitative representation of TCM principles.\nValidated through broad and extensive TCM patient data, the TCM-ES offers\nuniversal quantification of the TCM practice and therapeutic efficacy. We\nfurther map biomedical entities into the TCM-ES through correspondence\nalignment. We find that the principal directions of the TCM-ES are\nsignificantly associated with key biological functions (such as metabolism,\nimmune, and homeostasis), and that the disease and herb embedding proximity\naligns with their genetic relationships in the human protein interactome, which\ndemonstrate the biological significance of TCM principles. Moreover, the TCM-ES\nuncovers latent disease relationships, and provides alternative metric to\nassess clinical efficacy for modern disease-drug pairs. Finally, we construct a\ncomprehensive and integrative TCM knowledge graph, which predicts potential\nassociations between diseases and targets, drugs, herbal compounds, and herbal\ntherapies, providing TCM-informed opportunities for disease analysis and drug\ndevelopment.",

      "abstract": "With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural\nnetwork-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these\nmodels have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most\nexisting approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the\nconstruction of a separate model for each time series, which results in\nsubstantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing\npenalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal\nrelationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To\naddress these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural\nGranger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model\nand applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and\noutput to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific\ntime series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures\nsuch as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical\nsimulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC\noutperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational\noverhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder\nurothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in\nreconstructing gene regulatory networks.",

Traditional\ndiagnostic methods often fail to accurately identify and manage heart disease\nrisks, leading to adverse outcomes.

In this study, we proposed a comprehensive framework that combines\nclassification models for heart disease detection and regression models for\nrisk prediction. We employed the Heart Disease dataset, which comprises 1,035\ncases. To address the issue of class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority\nOversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, resulting in the generation of an\nadditional 100,000 synthetic data points. Performance metrics, including\naccuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, R2, MSE, RMSE, and MAE, were used to\nevaluate the model's effectiveness. Among the classification models, Random\nForest emerged as the standout performer, achieving an accuracy of 97.2% on\nreal data and 97.6% on synthetic data. For regression tasks, Linear Regression\ndemonstrated the highest R2 values of 0.992 and 0.984 on real and synthetic\ndatasets, respectively, with the lowest error metrics. Additionally,\nExplainable AI techniques were employed to enhance the interpretability of the\nmodels.

Temperature significantly impacted whether and\nwhen consensus was reached across all six LLMs. MAS with multiple personas\n(including neutral, assertive, or empathetic), significantly delayed consensus\nin four out of six LLMs compared to uniform personas. In three of those LLMs,\nhigher temperatures significantly diminished the effects of multiple personas\non consensus. However, neither temperature nor persona pairing lead to robust\nimprovements in coding accuracy. Single agents matched or outperformed MAS\nconsensus in most conditions. Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) and code\ncategory showed above-chance gains from MAS deliberation when temperature was\n0.5 or lower and especially when the agents included at least one assertive\npersona. Qualitative analysis of MAS collaboration for these configurations\nsuggests that MAS may nonetheless aid in narrowing ambiguous code applications\nthat could improve codebooks and human-AI coding.

While existing methods attempt to address various\nincomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality\ncombination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical\nlimitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict\nwith each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction\nmodel. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank\nadaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a\nnovel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal\nlearning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination\naware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The\nMCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct\ncharacteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts\nthe training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each\nmodality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across\ndifferent modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in\nmultiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms\nprevious incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Well-being in family settings involves subtle psychological dynamics that\nconventional metrics often overlook. In particular, unconscious parental\nexpectations, termed ideal parent bias, can suppress children's emotional\nexpression and autonomy. This suppression, referred to as suppressed emotion,\noften stems from well-meaning but value-driven communication, which is\ndifficult to detect or address from outside the family. Focusing on these\nlatent dynamics, this study explores Large Language Model (LLM)-based support\nfor psychologically safe family communication. We constructed a Japanese\nparent-child dialogue corpus of 30 scenarios, each annotated with metadata on\nideal parent bias and suppressed emotion. Based on this corpus, we developed a\nRole-Playing LLM-based multi-agent dialogue support framework that analyzes\ndialogue and generates feedback. Specialized agents detect suppressed emotion,\ndescribe implicit ideal parent bias in parental speech, and infer contextual\nattributes such as the child's age and background. A meta-agent compiles these\noutputs into a structured report, which is then passed to five selected expert\nagents. These agents collaboratively generate empathetic and actionable\nfeedback through a structured four-step discussion process. Experiments show\nthat the system can detect categories of suppressed emotion with moderate\naccuracy and produce feedback rated highly in empathy and practicality.\nMoreover, simulated follow-up dialogues incorporating this feedback exhibited\nsigns of improved emotional expression and mutual understanding, suggesting the\nframework's potential in supporting positive transformation in family\ninteractions.",

Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and\nlocal information have achieved promising results.

To address\nthis, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with\ndual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by\nsegregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message\npassing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways,\npreventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination.\nIn addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which\npartitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the\ncandidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which\nalleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality. Extensive experiments\non various datasets demonstrate that DuetGraph achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance, with up to an 8.7% improvement in reasoning quality and a\n1.8$\\times$ acceleration in training efficiency.",

Recent studies reveal that the goal of long\nvideo generation tasks is not only to extend video duration but also to\naccurately express richer narrative content within longer videos. However, due\nto the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video\ngeneration models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on\nbenchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our\nknowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively\nevaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models.\nInspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative\nunit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative\nAtom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness.\nGuided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we\nconstruct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing\nevaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs. (ii) Then, based\non the three progressive levels of narrative content expression, we design an\neffective evaluation metric using the MLLM-based question generation and\nanswering framework.

However, when sensitive attributes such as skin color are continuous,\ndividing into default groups may overlook or obscure the discrimination\nexperienced by certain minority subpopulations. To address this limitation, we\npropose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly\nmultidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed\nlevels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a\nnovel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby\nisolating the most critical subgroups.\n  We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and\ndemonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing\nhow discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes.\nFurthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the\ncase of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging\nthe skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that\nthe proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than\npreviously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for\na given model. Finally, we leverage our grouping model for debiasing purpose,\naiming at predicting fair scores with group-by-group post-processing.

      "abstract": "Smoke is the first visible indicator of a wildfire.With the advancement of\ndeep learning, image-based smoke detection has become a crucial method for\ndetecting and preventing forest fires. However, the scarcity of smoke image\ndata from forest fires is one of the significant factors hindering the\ndetection of forest fire smoke. Image generation models offer a promising\nsolution for synthesizing realistic smoke images. However, current inpainting\nmodels exhibit limitations in generating high-quality smoke representations,\nparticularly manifesting as inconsistencies between synthesized smoke and\nbackground contexts. To solve these problems, we proposed a comprehensive\nframework for generating forest fire smoke images. Firstly, we employed the\npre-trained segmentation model and the multimodal model to obtain smoke masks\nand image captions.Then, to address the insufficient utilization of masks and\nmasked images by inpainting models, we introduced a network architecture guided\nby mask and masked image features. We also proposed a new loss function, the\nmask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated\neffects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask\nedges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for\nsubsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a\nmultimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and\nreasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic\ndataset. Experiments showed that our generated smoke images are realistic and\ndiverse, and effectively enhance the performance of forest fire smoke detection\nmodels.

      "abstract": "3D visual grounding aims to identify and localize objects in a 3D space based\non textual descriptions. However, existing methods struggle with disentangling\ntargets from anchors in complex multi-anchor queries and resolving\ninconsistencies in spatial descriptions caused by perspective variations. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose ViewSRD, a framework that formulates 3D\nvisual grounding as a structured multi-view decomposition process. First, the\nSimple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor\nqueries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a\nstructured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional\nrelationships. These decomposed representations serve as the foundation for the\nMulti-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) module, which integrates\ntextual and scene features across multiple viewpoints using shared, Cross-modal\nConsistent View Tokens (CCVTs) to preserve spatial correlations. Finally, a\nTextual-Scene Reasoning module synthesizes multi-view predictions into a\nunified and robust 3D visual grounding. Experiments on 3D visual grounding\ndatasets show that ViewSRD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\nparticularly in complex queries requiring precise spatial differentiation.

Limited datasets, peculiar domain-specific and TI modality-specific\nchallenges, i.e., limited hardware, scale invariance issues due to greater\ndistances, deliberate occlusion by tactical vehicles, lower sensor resolution\nand resultant lack of structural information in targets, effects of weather,\ntemperature, and time of day variations, and varying target to clutter ratios\nall result in increased intra-class variability and higher inter-class\nsimilarity, making accurate real-time ATR a challenging CV task. Resultantly,\ncontemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning architectures underperform\nin the ATR domain. We propose a modified anchor-based single-stage detector,\ncalled YOLOatr, based on a modified YOLOv5s, with optimal modifications to the\ndetection heads, feature fusion in the neck, and a custom augmentation profile.\nWe evaluate the performance of our proposed model on a comprehensive DSIAC MWIR\ndataset for real-time ATR over both correlated and decorrelated testing\nprotocols.

To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a novel theoretical result that leverages the\nNeyman-Rubin potential outcomes framework into DRL. Unlike most methods that\nfocus on bounding the counterfactual loss, we establish a causal bound on the\nfactual loss, which is analogous to the on-policy loss in DRL. This bound is\ncomputed by storing past value network outputs in the experience replay buffer,\neffectively utilizing data that is usually discarded. Extensive experiments\nacross the Atari 2600 and MuJoCo domains on various agents, such as DQN and\nSAC, achieve up to 2,427% higher reward ratio, outperforming the same agents\nwithout our proposed term, and reducing the experience replay buffer size by up\nto 96%, significantly improving sample efficiency at negligible cost.",

This comprehensive\nmap is critical for hand-object interaction, enabling accurate grasping poses\nthat align with the task. We propose a two-stage pipeline that first constructs\na task-aware contact map informed by the scene and task. In the subsequent\nstage, we use this contact map to synthesize task-oriented human grasps. We\nintroduce a new dataset and a metric for the proposed task to evaluate our\napproach. Our experiments validate the importance of modeling both scene and\ntask, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods in both\ngrasp quality and task performance.

We propose an intermediate Intention Capture layer between user\nqueries and Workflow Generation, implementing the Opus Workflow Intention\nFramework, which consists of extracting Workflow Signals from user queries,\ninterpreting them into structured Workflow Intention objects, and generating\nWorkflows based on these Intentions. Our results show that this layer enables\nLLMs to produce logical and meaningful outputs that scale reliably as query\ncomplexity increases. On a synthetic benchmark of 1,000 multi-intent\nquery-Workflow(s) pairs, applying the Opus Prompt Intention Framework to\nWorkflow Generation yields consistent improvements in semantic Workflow\nsimilarity metrics. In this paper, we introduce the Opus Prompt Intention\nFramework by applying the concepts of Workflow Signal and Workflow Intention to\nLLM-driven Workflow Generation. We present a reproducible, customizable\nLLM-based Intention Capture system to extract Workflow Signals and Workflow\nIntentions from user queries. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the\nproposed system significantly improves Workflow Generation quality compared to\ndirect generation from user queries, particularly in cases of Mixed Intention\nElicitation.",

This paper\npresents a novel approach called the 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR),\nwhich leverages Magnetic Field Images (MFI) to retrieve the parameters for the\n3D current flow of a single-segment. The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning\n(DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based\nconstraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages:\ni) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\\ell/z_o$), where $\\ell$\nis the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic\nsensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging\nspatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for\nthe position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\\ell$), current ($I$), and current\nflow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer\nthen adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\\ell$, $I$) to\nminimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The\nresults demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information\nwith high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction\nin semiconductor packaging.

We show that a quadrotor drone\nequipped with a downward-facing event camera can estimate its attitude and\nrotation rate from just the event stream, enabling flight control without\ninertial sensors. Our approach uses a small recurrent convolutional neural\nnetwork trained through supervised learning. Real-world flight tests\ndemonstrate that our combination of event camera and low-latency neural network\nis capable of replacing the inertial measurement unit in a traditional flight\ncontrol loop. Furthermore, we investigate the network's generalization across\ndifferent environments, and the impact of memory and different fields of view.\nWhile networks with memory and access to horizon-like visual cues achieve best\nperformance, variants with a narrower field of view achieve better relative\ngeneralization.

In this paper, we highlight that\nthis can be insufficient for object surfaces to be represented in high quality.\nThus, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, enables Gaussian\nSplatting to incorporate multiple types of (geometrical) primitives during its\nsurface reconstruction process. Specifically, in our framework, we first\npropose a compositional splatting strategy, enabling the splatting and\nrendering of different types of primitives in the Gaussian Splatting pipeline.\nIn addition, we also design our framework with a mixed-primitive-based\ninitialization strategy and a vertex pruning mechanism to further promote its\nsurface representation learning process to be well executed leveraging\ndifferent types of primitives.

      "abstract": "Contestable AI requires that AI-driven decisions align with human\npreferences. While various forms of argumentation have been shown to support\ncontestability, Edge-Weighted Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks\n(EW-QBAFs) have received little attention. In this work, we show how EW-QBAFs\ncan be deployed for this purpose. Specifically, we introduce the contestability\nproblem for EW-QBAFs, which asks how to modify edge weights (e.g., preferences)\nto achieve a desired strength for a specific argument of interest (i.e., a\ntopic argument). To address this problem, we propose gradient-based relation\nattribution explanations (G-RAEs), which quantify the sensitivity of the topic\nargument's strength to changes in individual edge weights, thus providing\ninterpretable guidance for weight adjustments towards contestability. Building\non G-RAEs, we develop an iterative algorithm that progressively adjusts the\nedge weights to attain the desired strength. We evaluate our approach\nexperimentally on synthetic EW-QBAFs that simulate the structural\ncharacteristics of personalised recommender systems and multi-layer\nperceptrons, and demonstrate that it can solve the problem effectively.",

The large\nlanguage model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts\npossess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our\nresearch integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to\naddress the limitations of novelty assessment.

In this paper,\nwe propose leveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language\nmodels (PLMs, e.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers.\nSpecifically, we extract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper\nfrom peer review reports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of\nthe academic paper, which are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have\ndesigned a text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better\nintegrate human and LLM knowledge.

However, current\nsystolic-array-based accelerators face significant challenges when executing\nFlashAttention. Systolic arrays can only achieve high utilization for\nconsecutive and large matrix multiplications. In contrast, FlashAttention\nrequires frequently interleaved matrix multiplications and softmax operations.\n  The frequent data swaps between the systolic array and external vector units\nresult in low systolic array utilization. This is further exacerbated by the\nfact that softmax involves numerous non-matrix operations, which are not\nwell-suited for systolic arrays. Moreover, the concurrent execution of matrix\nmultiplication on systolic arrays and softmax on vector units leads to register\nfile and SRAM port contention, further degrading performance.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose FSA, an enhanced systolic array\narchitecture that enables the entire FlashAttention algorithm to run entirely\nwithin a single systolic array, eliminating the need for external vector units.\nAt the core of FSA is SystolicAttention, a novel scheduling algorithm that maps\nFlashAttention operations onto systolic arrays with fine-grained, element-wise\noverlap. This significantly improves array utilization while preserving the\noriginal floating-point operation order to maintain numerical stability.\n  We implement FSA in synthesizable RTL and evaluate its performance against\nstate-of-the-art commercial accelerators.

However,\nexisting MVS methods often struggle with challenging regions, such as\ntextureless regions and reflective surfaces, where feature matching fails. In\ncontrast, monocular depth estimation inherently does not require feature\nmatching, allowing it to achieve robust relative depth estimation in these\nregions. To bridge this gap, we propose MonoMVSNet, a novel monocular feature\nand depth guided MVS network that integrates powerful priors from a monocular\nfoundation model into multi-view geometry. Firstly, the monocular feature of\nthe reference view is integrated into source view features by the attention\nmechanism with a newly designed cross-view position encoding. Then, the\nmonocular depth of the reference view is aligned to dynamically update the\ndepth candidates for edge regions during the sampling procedure. Finally, a\nrelative consistency loss is further designed based on the monocular depth to\nsupervise the depth prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nMonoMVSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU and\nTanks-and-Temples datasets, ranking first on the Tanks-and-Temples Intermediate\nand Advanced benchmarks.

      "abstract": "Mobile robots are increasingly required to navigate and interact within\nunknown and unstructured environments to meet human demands. Demand-driven\nnavigation (DDN) enables robots to identify and locate objects based on\nimplicit human intent, even when object locations are unknown. However,\ntraditional data-driven DDN methods rely on pre-collected data for model\ntraining and decision-making, limiting their generalization capability in\nunseen scenarios. In this paper, we propose CogDDN, a VLM-based framework that\nemulates the human cognitive and learning mechanisms by integrating fast and\nslow thinking systems and selectively identifying key objects essential to\nfulfilling user demands. CogDDN identifies appropriate target objects by\nsemantically aligning detected objects with the given instructions.\nFurthermore, it incorporates a dual-process decision-making module, comprising\na Heuristic Process for rapid, efficient decisions and an Analytic Process that\nanalyzes past errors, accumulates them in a knowledge base, and continuously\nimproves performance. Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning strengthens the\ndecision-making process. Extensive closed-loop evaluations on the AI2Thor\nsimulator with the ProcThor dataset show that CogDDN outperforms single-view\ncamera-only methods by 15%, demonstrating significant improvements in\nnavigation accuracy and adaptability.

This lack of omni datasets and lightweight,\ncapable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video\nunderstanding. To address these challenges, we introduce UGC-VideoCap, a new\nbenchmark and model framework specifically designed for detailed omnimodal\ncaptioning of short form user-generated videos. Unlike prior datasets,\nUGC-VideoCap emphasizes balanced integration of audio and visual modalities,\nfeaturing 1000 TikTok videos annotated through a structured three stage\nhuman-in-the-loop pipeline covering audio only, visual only, and joint audio\nvisual semantics. The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs\nprobing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we\npropose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from\nGemini 2.5 Flash. Using a novel two-stage training strategy supervised fine\ntuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our approach\nenables efficient adaptation from limited data while maintaining competitive\nperformance.

While popular methods like integer programming yield logistics\nplans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, they are slow and assume\nan idealized mathematical model of the environment that does not account for\nuncertainty. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can handle\nuncertainty and promise to accelerate replanning while lowering the barrier to\nentry by translating free-form utterances into executable plans, yet they\nremain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety\nand cost. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility\nof natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation.\nIt converts user requests into structured planning specifications, quantifies\nits own uncertainty at the field and token level, and invokes an interactive\nclarification loop whenever confidence falls below an adaptive threshold. A\nlightweight model, fine-tuned on just 100 uncertainty-filtered examples,\nsurpasses the zero-shot performance of GPT-4.1 while cutting inference latency\nby nearly 50%.

We propose a\nnovel approach that trains each layer of the neural network using local signals\nduring the forward pass in RL settings. Our approach introduces local,\nlayer-wise losses leveraging the principle of matching pairwise distances from\nmulti-dimensional scaling, enhanced with optional reward-driven guidance. This\nmethod allows each hidden layer to be trained using local signals computed\nduring forward propagation, thus eliminating the need for backward passes and\nstoring intermediate activations. Our experiments, conducted with policy\ngradient methods across common RL benchmarks, demonstrate that this\nbackpropagation-free method achieves competitive performance compared to their\nclassical BP-based counterpart. Additionally, the proposed method enhances\nstability and consistency within and across runs, and improves performance\nespecially in challenging environments.",

During training,\nthese contrastive losses focus exclusively on identity information as labels.\nHowever, we observe a multiscale geometric structure emerging in the embedding\nspace, influenced by interpretable facial (e.g., hair color) and image\nattributes (e.g., contrast). We propose a geometric approach to describe the\ndependence or invariance of FR models to these attributes and introduce a\nphysics-inspired alignment metric. We evaluate the proposed metric on\ncontrolled, simplified models and widely used FR models fine-tuned with\nsynthetic data for targeted attribute augmentation. Our findings reveal that\nthe models exhibit varying degrees of invariance across different attributes,\nproviding insight into their strengths and weaknesses and enabling deeper\ninterpretability.

Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary\nmatrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable\nexploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using\nentanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define\nunconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per\nqubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and\nevaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified\n64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently\noutperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing\nconfigurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical\nmodel (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring,\nnearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the\nclassical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered\nup to ~20% higher accuracy.

Existing methods like U-Net and its variants often\nsuffer from limited global Effective Receptive Fields (ERFs), hindering their\nability to capture long-range dependencies. To address this, we propose U-RWKV,\na novel framework leveraging the Recurrent Weighted Key-Value(RWKV)\narchitecture, which achieves efficient long-range modeling at O(N)\ncomputational cost. The framework introduces two key innovations: the\nDirection-Adaptive RWKV Module(DARM) and the Stage-Adaptive\nSqueeze-and-Excitation Module(SASE). DARM employs Dual-RWKV and QuadScan\nmechanisms to aggregate contextual cues across images, mitigating directional\nbias while preserving global context and maintaining high computational\nefficiency. SASE dynamically adapts its architecture to different feature\nextraction stages, balancing high-resolution detail preservation and semantic\nrelationship capture. Experiments demonstrate that U-RWKV achieves\nstate-of-the-art segmentation performance with high computational efficiency,\noffering a practical solution for democratizing advanced medical imaging\ntechnologies in resource-constrained environments.

However, the impact of\nactivation functions on deep learning (DL) performance in the fNIRS domain\nremains underexplored and lacks systematic investigation in the current\nliterature. This study evaluates a range of conventional and field-specific\nactivation functions for fNIRS classification tasks using multiple deep\nlearning architectures, including the domain-specific fNIRSNet, AbsoluteNet,\nMDNN, and shallowConvNet (as the baseline), all tested on a single dataset\nrecorded during an auditory task. To ensure fair a comparison, all networks\nwere trained and tested using standardized preprocessing and consistent\ntraining parameters. The results show that symmetrical activation functions\nsuch as Tanh and the Absolute value function Abs(x) can outperform commonly\nused functions like the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), depending on the\narchitecture.

Conventional\ntechniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while\ndata-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural\nRepresentations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous\nmappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images,\nthereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the\ngeneralization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces\nchallenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images),\na novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First,\nrecognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we\naccelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm,\nmixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a\nparallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image\nstorage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a\nnovel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while\nmaintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging\ndatasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior\nPSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while\naccelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times.",

In this work, we extend the application\nof DEQs to Poisson inverse problems, where the data fidelity term is more\nappropriately modeled by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. To this end, we\nintroduce a novel DEQ formulation based on Mirror Descent defined in terms of a\ntailored non-Euclidean geometry that naturally adapts with the structure of the\ndata term. This enables the learning of neural regularizers within a principled\ntraining framework. We derive sufficient conditions to guarantee the\nconvergence of the learned reconstruction scheme and propose computational\nstrategies that enable both efficient training and fully parameter-free\ninference. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms traditional\nmodel-based approaches and it is comparable to the performance of Bregman\nPlug-and-Play methods, while mitigating their typical drawbacks - namely,\nsensitivity to initialization and careful tuning of hyperparameters.

Traditional statistical shape\nmodeling (SSM) methods rely on linear assumptions, limiting their expressivity\nand scalability to complex topologies such as multi-branch vascular structures.\nWe introduce HUG-VAS, a Hierarchical NURBS Generative model for Vascular\ngeometry Synthesis, which integrates NURBS surface parameterization with\ndiffusion-based generative modeling to synthesize realistic, fine-grained\naortic geometries. Trained with 21 patient-specific samples, HUG-VAS generates\nanatomically faithful aortas with supra-aortic branches, yielding biomarker\ndistributions that closely match those of the original dataset. HUG-VAS adopts\na hierarchical architecture comprising a denoising diffusion model that\ngenerates centerlines and a guided diffusion model that synthesizes radial\nprofiles conditioned on those centerlines, thereby capturing two layers of\nanatomical variability. Critically, the framework supports zero-shot\nconditional generation from image-derived priors, enabling practical\napplications such as interactive semi-automatic segmentation, robust\nreconstruction under degraded imaging conditions, and implantable device\noptimization. To our knowledge, HUG-VAS is the first SSM framework to bridge\nimage-derived priors with generative shape modeling via a unified integration\nof NURBS parameterization and hierarchical diffusion processes.",

We present\nCombinatorial Convolution-based Circle Fitting for Blurry Images (3C-FBI), an\nalgorithm that bridges the gap between circle detection and precise parametric\nfitting by combining (1) efficient combinatorial edge pixel (edgel) sampling\nand (2) convolution-based density estimation in parameter space.\n  We evaluate 3C-FBI across three experimental frameworks: (1) real-world\nmedical data from Parkinson's disease assessments (144 frames from 36 videos),\n(2) controlled synthetic data following established circle-fitting benchmarks,\nand (3) systematic analysis across varying spatial resolutions and outlier\ncontamination levels. Results show that 3C-FBI achieves state-of-the-art\naccuracy (Jaccard index 0.896) while maintaining real-time performance (40.3\nfps), significantly outperforming classical methods like RCD (6.8 fps) on a\nstandard CPU (i7-10875H). It maintains near-perfect accuracy (Jaccard almost\n1.0) at high resolutions (480x480) and reliable performance (Jaccard higher\nthan 0.95) down to 160x160 with up to 20% outliers.\n  In extensive synthetic testing, 3C-FBI achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.989\nacross contamination levels, comparable to modern methods like Qi et al.

We propose a framework, inspired\nby open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three \"dogmas.\" We\nrevisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To\nmake our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first\nestablish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains\nover an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational\nprocesses. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary\ninsights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning. We\nthen address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis,\nusing analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs.\nmulti-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration\nin RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence\nof a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the\nevolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it\ngestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from\norigins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication\noffer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained\nreinforcement learning in biological systems.",

This paper introduces the Human\nPerception-Based Fuzzy Color Model, COLIBRI (Color Linguistic-Based\nRepresentation and Interpretation), designed to bridge the gap between\ncomputational color representations and human visual perception. The proposed\nmodel uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization.\nUsing a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies\ndistinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through\npreliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey\ninvolving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract\nfuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world\nperceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that\nallows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative\nevaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to\ntraditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. To the best of our\nknowledge, no previous research has documented the construction of a model for\ncolor attribute specification based on a sample of this size or a comparable\nsample of the human population (n = 2496).

To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential\ndecision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates\ncoarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic\ncomplexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models\n(DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The\ntwo modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the\nClassifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards.\nExperiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM\nconsistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing\ntransmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven,\ndiffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning\nover the air.",

      "abstract": "Foundation models, pre-trained on large image datasets and capable of\ncapturing rich feature representations, have recently shown potential for\nzero-shot image registration. However, their performance has mostly been tested\nin the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or\nabdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more\nchallenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly\ndifficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation\ncaused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal\nstructure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial.\nWhether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level\nof complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for\nbreast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM,\nMedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that\ncapture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and\npatient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that\nfoundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional\nregistration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large\ndomain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular\ntissue. Interestingly, additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical or\nbreast-specific images in MedSAM and SSLSAM, does not improve registration\nperformance and may even decrease it in some cases. Further work is needed to\nunderstand how domain-specific training influences registration and to explore\ntargeted strategies that improve both global alignment and fine structure\naccuracy. We also publicly release our code at\n\\href{https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/Foundation-based-reg}{Github}.",

Materials and\nMethods: We compared traditional ML models (e.g., linear regression, random\nforest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost) with our developed model,\nSurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an\nattention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data.\nPerformance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key\npredictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved\nthe highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85)\nand baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by\ndynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative\nclinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most\ncontributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone\ndisorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most\nimpactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention\nmechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential\nnature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher\naccuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical\nadoption. These results highlight the potential of integrating attention-based\ntemporal models into hospital planning workflows. Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM\npresents an effective and interpretable AI solution for LOS prediction in\nelective spine surgery.

It further analyzes over 63,000 gait cycles from the OU-ISIR dataset to quantify correlations between age and metrics like stride length and walking speed, fine-tunes a ResNet34 model with Grad-CAM to show attention on knee and pelvic regions, and compares machine learning models on the VersatileGait database, achieving up to 96% accuracy and providing guidelines to reduce error below three years in real-world scenarios.",

We introduce the Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO), a framework\nthat transforms neural operator-based virtual sensing with calibrated,\ndistribution-free prediction intervals. By unifying Monte Carlo dropout with\nsplit conformal prediction in a single DeepONet architecture, CMCO achieves\nspatially resolved uncertainty estimates without retraining, ensembling, or\ncustom loss design. Our method addresses a longstanding challenge: how to endow\noperator learning with efficient and reliable UQ across heterogeneous domains.\nThrough rigorous evaluation on three distinct applications: turbulent flow,\nelastoplastic deformation, and global cosmic radiation dose estimation-CMCO\nconsistently attains near-nominal empirical coverage, even in settings with\nstrong spatial gradients and proxy-based sensing. This breakthrough offers a\ngeneral-purpose, plug-and-play UQ solution for neural operators, unlocking\nreal-time, trustworthy inference in digital twins, sensor fusion, and\nsafety-critical monitoring. By bridging theory and deployment with minimal\ncomputational overhead, CMCO establishes a new foundation for scalable,\ngeneralizable, and uncertainty-aware scientific machine learning.",

This project explores different CV approaches to create a\nre-ID model able to identify individual feral cats in the wild. The main\napproach consists of modifying a part-pose guided network (PPGNet) model,\ninitially used in the re-ID of Amur tigers, to be applicable for feral cats.\nThis adaptation, resulting in PPGNet-Cat, which incorporates specific\nmodifications to suit the characteristics of feral cats images. Additionally,\nvarious experiments were conducted, particularly exploring contrastive learning\napproaches such as ArcFace loss. The main results indicate that PPGNet-Cat\nexcels in identifying feral cats, achieving high performance with a mean\nAverage Precision (mAP) of 0.86 and a rank-1 accuracy of 0.95.

However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to\nthe need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast\nnumbers of cells.

To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale\nSpatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model.

Then an SE(2)\nTransformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the\nsub-slices. Additionally, we construct \\textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest\nhigh-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining.

Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant\nchallenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena\nusing conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional\ntensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders\nthat learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings\nsupport a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection,\nsimilarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised\nclassification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray\nastronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and\nspectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our\nframework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing\ncomplex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.",

Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and\nautomated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs\nare not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative\non-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on\ntwo-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal\ncar-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral\nlane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for\nhuman-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human\nfactors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a\nHCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based\non the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model\nbased on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the\nelitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and\nefficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under\ndifferent traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The\nfindings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in\nenhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging\nprocess, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption\ncompared with benchmarks.",

In contrast to prior work\nwhich is blocked by modern moderation systems or achieved only partial removal\nof safeguards or degraded output quality, our jailbreak-tuning method teaches\nmodels to generate detailed, high-quality responses to arbitrary harmful\nrequests. For example, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic models will fully comply\nwith requests for CBRN assistance, executing cyberattacks, and other criminal\nactivity. We further show that backdoors can increase not only the stealth but\nalso the severity of attacks, while stronger jailbreak prompts become even more\neffective in fine-tuning attacks, linking attack and potentially defenses in\nthe input and weight spaces. Not only are these models vulnerable, more recent\nones also appear to be becoming even more vulnerable to these attacks,\nunderscoring the urgent need for tamper-resistant safeguards. Until such\nsafeguards are discovered, companies and policymakers should view the release\nof any fine-tunable model as simultaneously releasing its evil twin: equally\ncapable as the original model, and usable for any malicious purpose within its\ncapabilities.",

The main objective is to\ndevelop a model capable of performing sentiment analysis in Persian using\nlimited data, while getting prior knowledge from high-resource languages. To\nachieve this, three pre-trained multilingual models (XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa, and\nDistilBERT) were employed, which were fine-tuned using few-shot and incremental\nlearning approaches on small samples of Persian data from diverse sources,\nincluding X, Instagram, Digikala, Snappfood, and Taaghche. This variety enabled\nthe models to learn from a broad range of contexts. Experimental results show\nthat the mDeBERTa and XLM-RoBERTa achieved high performances, reaching 96%\naccuracy on Persian sentiment analysis. These findings highlight the\neffectiveness of combining few-shot learning and incremental learning with\nmultilingual pre-trained models.",

      "abstract": "Speech quality assessment (SQA) is often used to learn a mapping from a\nhigh-dimensional input space to a scalar that represents the mean opinion score\n(MOS) of the perceptual speech quality. Learning such a mapping is challenging\nfor many reasons, but largely because MOS exhibits high levels of inherent\nvariance due to perceptual and experimental-design differences. Many solutions\nhave been proposed, but many approaches do not properly incorporate perceptual\nfactors into their learning algorithms (beyond the MOS label), which could lead\nto unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose JSQA, a two-stage framework\nthat pretrains an audio encoder using perceptually-guided contrastive learning\non just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS\nprediction. We first generate pairs of audio data within JND levels, which are\nthen used to pretrain an encoder to leverage perceptual quality similarity\ninformation and map it into an embedding space. The JND pairs come from clean\nLibriSpeech utterances that are mixed with background noise from CHiME-3, at\ndifferent signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The encoder is later fine-tuned with\naudio samples from the NISQA dataset for MOS prediction. Experimental results\nsuggest that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly\nimproves the model performance evaluated by various metrics when compared\nagainst the same network trained from scratch without pretraining. These\nfindings suggest that incorporating perceptual factors into pretraining greatly\ncontributes to the improvement in performance for SQA.",

While\nsubstantial progress has been made for normal logic programs, the development\nof practical counters for disjunctive logic programs remains challenging.\n  We present SharpASP-SR, a novel framework for counting answer sets of\ndisjunctive logic programs based on subtractive reduction to projected\npropositional model counting. Our approach introduces an alternative\ncharacterization of answer sets that enables efficient reduction while ensuring\nthat intermediate representations remain of polynomial size. This allows\nSharpASP-SR to leverage recent advances in projected model counting technology.\nThrough extensive experimental evaluation on diverse benchmarks, we demonstrate\nthat SharpASP-SR significantly outperforms existing counters on instances with\nlarge answer set counts. Building on these results, we develop a hybrid\ncounting approach that combines enumeration techniques with SharpASP-SR to\nachieve state-of-the-art performance across the full spectrum of disjunctive\nprograms.",

However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in\naccuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of\nheterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,\na diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting\na new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.",

In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the\nimplications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected\ncoresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an\nextensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations\nbenchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty,\nand five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes.\nThereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between\nsample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant\nmodel robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using\nembedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk\nof inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based\non learning dynamics. Most importantly, our analysis reveals that although some\ncoreset selection methods could achieve lower bias levels by prioritizing\ndifficult samples, they do not reliably guarantee downstream robustness.",

Through an extensive empirical study involving ten spurious correlations benchmarks, five sample importance metrics, and five data selection policies across various coreset sizes, the authors analyze interactions between sample difficulty, bias alignment, and model robustness, revealing key insights such as the lower risk of bias exacerbation with embedding-based scores compared to learning dynamics-based ones, and the finding that reduced bias in coresets does not reliably ensure downstream robustness, particularly for small coresets.",

While these images often provide sufficient details to analyze the\nshape of the galaxies, accurate analysis of such high volumes of images\nrequires effective automation. Current solutions often rely on machine learning\nannotation of the galaxy images based on a set of pre-defined classes. Here we\nintroduce a new approach to galaxy image analysis that is based on generative\nAI. The method simplifies the galaxy images and automatically converts them\ninto a ``skeletonized\" form. The simplified images allow accurate measurements\nof the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined\nset of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images\nacquired by the DESI Legacy Survey. The code and data are publicly available.\nThe method was applied to 125,000 DESI Legacy Survey images, and the catalog of\nthe simplified images is publicly available.",

While intuitive and locally accurate, traditional local\nforecasting models (LFMs) face significant limitations, particularly in\nhandling generalizability, overfitting, data drift, and the cold start problem.\nThese methods also struggle with scalability, becoming computationally\nexpensive and less efficient as the network's size and data volume grow. In\ncontrast, global forecasting models (GFMs) offer a new approach to enhance\nprediction generalizability, scalability, accuracy, and robustness through\nglobalization and cross-learning. This paper investigates global load\nforecasting in the presence of data drifts, highlighting the impact of\ndifferent modeling techniques and data heterogeneity. We explore\nfeature-transforming and target-transforming models, demonstrating how\nglobalization, data heterogeneity, and data drift affect each differently. In\naddition, we examine the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and its\npotential for hierarchical forecasting. To address data heterogeneity and the\nbalance between globality and locality, we propose separate time series\nclustering (TSC) methods, introducing model-based TSC for feature-transforming\nmodels and new weighted instance-based TSC for target-transforming models.\nThrough extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alberta's electricity\nload, we demonstrate that global target-transforming models consistently\noutperform their local counterparts, especially when enriched with global\nfeatures and clustering techniques. In contrast, global feature-transforming\nmodels face challenges in balancing local and global dynamics, often requiring\nTSC to manage data heterogeneity effectively.",

Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines\nexcel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor\nscenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering\nend-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work\nsystematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B,\nInternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline\n(PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with\nsynthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results\nreveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight\nCNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction\nof the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To\nfoster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and\nevaluation code publicly.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the\npotential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges\ndue to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of\ntraining data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing\nLLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such\nas linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark\ncovering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic\nevaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a\n7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on\nhard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel\nsynthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a\nlimited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for\ndiversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key\ninsight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong\ncorrectness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such\nguarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse\nformulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both\napproaches and the importance of combining them.",

Investigating a notebook via re-execution\noften is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software\ndependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases\nhave demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we\nobserve that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to\nhallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose\na notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and\ncorresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to\nassist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve\nAssisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and\nanalysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct\ninterpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the\ninter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via\ncell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and\noutputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted\nKaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.\nThe LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the\nsyntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves\naverage F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99%\nidentifying transitive cell execution dependencies.",

Designing intelligent systems with\nhuman-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial\nintelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable\nsuccess in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs\nor parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often\nmeans retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures,\nwhich increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific\napproaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver\n(UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we\nprove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of\nestimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we\nillustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional\ngenerative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a\nsingle round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning\nability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of\nzero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from\nunseen AVR tasks in the testing phase.",

This\nresearch addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway\nnetwork by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological\nfeatures. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and\nneglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple\neffects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology,\noriginally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air\nnetwork, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node\nCentrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest,\nDecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is\nto predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited\nperformance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the\nnecessity for more context-specific adaptations.

      "abstract": "Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography\n(EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The\ninability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their\nover-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards\ngeneral-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models\n(EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the\nreal-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research\nprogress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of\nfirst-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end,\nthis study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their\nmethodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that\nmost EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on\ntransformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for\nself-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely\nlimited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility.\nIn addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work\nshould demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and\ntrustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We\nbelieve that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies,\nand applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the\ntranslational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.",

As the expectations for precision,\nautomation, and scalability intensify, conventional inspection approaches are\nincreasingly found wanting in addressing real-world demands. Notable progress\nin computer vision and deep learning has substantially bolstered defect\ndetection capabilities across both 2D and 3D modalities. A significant\ndevelopment has been the pivot from closed-set to open-set defect detection\nframeworks, which diminishes the necessity for extensive defect annotations and\nfacilitates the recognition of novel anomalies. Despite such strides, a\ncohesive and contemporary understanding of industrial defect detection remains\nelusive. Consequently, this survey delivers an in-depth analysis of both\nclosed-set and open-set defect detection strategies within 2D and 3D\nmodalities, charting their evolution in recent years and underscoring the\nrising prominence of open-set techniques.

We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the\ngenerated synthetic data, assessing semantic diversity through clustering and\ndistributional metrics, human-likeness via LLM-based quality scoring, realism\nthrough comparison with real-world emotion corpora, and practical utility in\ndownstream emotion classification tasks.

      "abstract": "Vision Mamba models promise transformer-level performance at linear\ncomputational cost, but their reliance on serializing 2D images into 1D\nsequences introduces a critical, yet overlooked, design choice: the patch scan\norder. In medical imaging, where modalities like brain MRI contain strong\nanatomical priors, this choice is non-trivial. This paper presents the first\nsystematic study of how scan order impacts MRI segmentation. We introduce\nMulti-Scan 2D (MS2D), a parameter-free module for Mamba-based architectures\nthat facilitates exploring diverse scan paths without additional computational\ncost. We conduct a large-scale benchmark of 21 scan strategies on three public\ndatasets (BraTS 2020, ISLES 2022, LGG), covering over 70,000 slices. Our\nanalysis shows conclusively that scan order is a statistically significant\nfactor (Friedman test: $\\chi^{2}_{20}=43.9, p=0.0016$), with performance\nvarying by as much as 27 Dice points. Spatially contiguous paths -- simple\nhorizontal and vertical rasters -- consistently outperform disjointed diagonal\nscans. We conclude that scan order is a powerful, cost-free hyperparameter, and\nprovide an evidence-based shortlist of optimal paths to maximize the\nperformance of Mamba models in medical imaging.",

A promising tool for PQoS is given by\nReinforcement Learning (RL), a methodology that enables the design of\ndecision-making strategies for stochastic optimization. In this manuscript, we\npresent PRATA, a new simulation framework to enable PRedictive QoS based on AI\nfor Teleoperated driving Applications. PRATA consists of a modular pipeline\nthat includes (i) an end-to-end protocol stack to simulate the 5G Radio Access\nNetwork (RAN), (ii) a tool for generating automotive data, and (iii) an\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) unit to optimize PQoS decisions. To prove its\nutility, we use PRATA to design an RL unit, named RAN-AI, to optimize the\nsegmentation level of teleoperated driving data in the event of resource\nsaturation or channel degradation. Hence, we show that the RAN-AI entity\nefficiently balances the trade-off between QoS and Quality of Experience (QoE)\nthat characterize teleoperated driving applications, almost doubling the system\nperformance compared to baseline approaches. In addition, by varying the\nlearning settings of the RAN-AI entity, we investigate the impact of the state\nspace and the relative cost of acquiring network data that are necessary for\nthe implementation of RL.",

It has\nshown significant potential in various domains, including healthcare and\npersonalized recommendation systems. However, most existing work on federated\nrecommendation systems has focused primarily on improving accuracy, with\nlimited attention to fairness and diversity. In this paper, we introduce\nFedFlex, a federated recommender system for Netflix-style TV series\nrecommendations. FedFlex integrates two state-of-the-art matrix factorization\nalgorithms for personalized fine-tuning. FedFlex also applies Maximal Marginal\nRelevance (MMR) to re-rank items and enhance diversity. We conduct extensive\nexperiments comparing recommendations generated by SVD and BPR algorithms. In a\nlive two-week user study, participants received two recommendation lists: List\nA, based on SVD or BPR, and List B, a re-ranked version emphasizing diversity.\nParticipants were asked to click on the movies they were interested in\nwatching. Our findings demonstrate that FedFlex effectively introduces diverse\ncontent, such as new genres, into recommendations without necessarily\ncompromising user satisfaction.",

However, how to\nintelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a\nstructure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a\ntwo-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction\nvalues of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods\nare designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced\ndeep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an\nimproved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full\neigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is\nachieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method.\nFurthermore, we derive the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under\nmultiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation\nresults show that the developed three methods achieve 100\\% number of targets\nsensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior\nunder extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing\nclustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.",
