      "abstract": "High responsiveness and economic efficiency are critical objectives in supply\nchain transportation, both of which are influenced by strategic decisions on\nshipping mode. An integrated framework combining an efficient simulator with an\nintelligent decision-making algorithm can provide an observable, low-risk\nenvironment for transportation strategy design. An ideal simulation-decision\nframework must (1) generalize effectively across various settings, (2) reflect\nfine-grained transportation dynamics, (3) integrate historical experience with\npredictive insights, and (4) maintain tight integration between simulation\nfeedback and policy refinement. We propose Sim-to-Dec framework to satisfy\nthese requirements. Specifically, Sim-to-Dec consists of a generative\nsimulation module, which leverages autoregressive modeling to simulate\ncontinuous state changes, reducing dependence on handcrafted domain-specific\nrules and enhancing robustness against data fluctuations; and a history-future\ndual-aware decision model, refined iteratively through end-to-end optimization\nwith simulator interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that Sim-to-Dec significantly improves timely\ndelivery rates and profit.",

Unlike conventional approaches that select interventions\naimed at inferring the full causal model, GO-CBED directly maximizes the\nexpected information gain (EIG) on user-specified causal quantities of\ninterest, enabling more targeted and efficient experimentation. The framework\nis both non-myopic, optimizing over entire intervention sequences, and\ngoal-oriented, targeting only model aspects relevant to the causal query. To\naddress the intractability of exact EIG computation, we introduce a variational\nlower bound estimator, optimized jointly through a transformer-based policy\nnetwork and normalizing flow-based variational posteriors. The resulting policy\nenables real-time decision-making via an amortized network. We demonstrate that\nGO-CBED consistently outperforms existing baselines across various causal\nreasoning and discovery tasks-including synthetic structural causal models and\nsemi-synthetic gene regulatory networks-particularly in settings with limited\nexperimental budgets and complex causal mechanisms. Our results highlight the\nbenefits of aligning experimental design objectives with specific research\ngoals and of forward-looking sequential planning.",

Current graph-based methods for disease classification\ndetect patient-specific molecular fingerprints, but lack consistency and\ncomprehension regarding cohort-wide features, which are an essential\nrequirement for understanding pathogenic phenotypes across diverse\natherosclerotic trajectories. Furthermore, understanding patient subtypes often\nconsiders clinical feature similarity in isolation, without integration of\nshared pathogenic interdependencies among patients. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce ATHENA: Atherosclerosis Through Hierarchical\nExplainable Neural Network Analysis, which constructs a novel hierarchical\nnetwork representation through integrated modality learning; subsequently, it\noptimizes learned patient-specific molecular fingerprints that reflect\nindividual omics data, enforcing consistency with cohort-wide patterns. With a\nprimary clinical dataset of 391 patients, we demonstrate that this\nheterogeneous alignment of clinical features with molecular interaction\npatterns has significantly boosted subclinical atherosclerosis classification\nperformance across various baselines by up to 13% in area under the receiver\noperating curve (AUC) and 20% in F1 score. Taken together, ATHENA enables\nmechanistically-informed patient subtype discovery through explainable AI\n(XAI)-driven subnetwork clustering; this novel integration framework\nstrengthens personalized intervention strategies, thereby improving the\nprediction of atherosclerotic disease progression and management of their\nclinical actionable outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level\nrecognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES\nmodels typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift\nModule (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with\ntemporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive\nfield and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift\nModule (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and\nmulti-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and\nlong-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a\nlightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D\nbackbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis\nAustralia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing\nover 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES\nbenchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with\nminimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar\nimagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,\nand reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of\npenetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In\nthis work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice\nlayer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the\nspatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT\nleverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local\nspatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and\nspatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies\neffectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from\nthe Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by\nachieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages\nof self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,\nincluding the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture\nlong-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal\nattention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial\nrelationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and\neffective approach.",

Existing motion transfer\nmethods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment\n(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often\nneglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To\nbridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework\nfor cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model\nintroduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,\nallowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual\ncharacteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to\nfacilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl\ndataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive\nexperiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our\nproposed model.",

      "abstract": "Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections\nobtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo\ncollections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These\nunconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient\nocclusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods\ncannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting\nconditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method\nbased on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable\nfor in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for\neach 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature\nembeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in\nthe 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to\nsmooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and\ncalculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We\nalso designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild\nscenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,\nSeg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality.

However, these methods\nface the issue of a mismatch between the pre-trained model and downstream\ntasks, leading to suboptimal performance in certain application scenarios.\nPrompt learning methods have emerged as a new direction in heterogeneous graph\ntasks, as they allow flexible adaptation of task representations to address\ntarget inconsistency. Building on this idea, this paper proposes a novel\nmulti-task prompt framework for the heterogeneous graph domain, named HGMP.\nFirst, to bridge the gap between the pre-trained model and downstream tasks, we\nreformulate all downstream tasks into a unified graph-level task format. Next,\nwe address the limitations of existing graph prompt learning methods, which\nstruggle to integrate contrastive pre-training strategies in the heterogeneous\ngraph domain. We design a graph-level contrastive pre-training strategy to\nbetter leverage heterogeneous information and enhance performance in multi-task\nscenarios. Finally, we introduce heterogeneous feature prompts, which enhance\nmodel performance by refining the representation of input graph features.\nExperimental results on public datasets show that our proposed method adapts\nwell to various tasks and significantly outperforms baseline methods.",

This paper presents a comparative evaluation of\ntraditional Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and quantized\nsmall-parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) for phishing detection. Through\nexperiments on a curated dataset, we show that while LLMs currently\nunderperform compared to ML and DL methods in terms of raw accuracy, they\nexhibit strong potential for identifying subtle, context-based phishing cues.\nWe also investigate the impact of zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies,\nrevealing that LLM-rephrased emails can significantly degrade the performance\nof both ML and LLM-based detectors. Our benchmarking highlights that models\nlike DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14B (Q8_0) achieve competitive accuracy, above\n80%, using only 17GB of VRAM, supporting their viability for cost-efficient\ndeployment. We further assess the models' adversarial robustness and\ncost-performance tradeoffs, and demonstrate how lightweight LLMs can provide\nconcise, interpretable explanations to support real-time decision-making. These\nfindings position optimized LLMs as promising components in phishing defence\nsystems and offer a path forward for integrating explainable, efficient AI into\nmodern cybersecurity frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Online advertising is a vital revenue source for major internet platforms.\nRecently, joint advertising, which assigns a bundle of two advertisers in an ad\nslot instead of allocating a single advertiser, has emerged as an effective\nmethod for enhancing allocation efficiency and revenue. However, existing\nmechanisms for joint advertising fail to realize the optimality, as they tend\nto focus on individual advertisers and overlook bundle structures. This paper\nidentifies an optimal mechanism for joint advertising in a single-slot setting.\nFor multi-slot joint advertising, we propose \\textbf{BundleNet}, a novel\nbundle-based neural network approach specifically designed for joint\nadvertising. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the mechanisms\ngenerated by \\textbf{BundleNet} approximate the theoretical analysis results in\nthe single-slot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in the\nmulti-slot setting. This significantly increases platform revenue while\nensuring approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility and individual\nrationality.",

However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant\nlimitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks\nrequiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work,\nwe present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning\ncapabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for\ninformative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector\n(GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT\nreasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality\nmultimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from\ndiverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid\nwith a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its\nstep-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective\ninference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning\nand under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art\nMLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical\nreasoning and science problem-solving.

      "abstract": "Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity\nand non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce\nsubstantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ\nsegmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we\npropose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to\nenhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual\nsemantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we\nintroduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a\nchannel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,\neffectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on\npixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global\nSemantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional\nlocal features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with\nconditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent\nframes. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,\nsignificantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive\nevaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since\nour model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly\nhigher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some\nimage-based models.

The benchmark offers a unified,\nuser-friendly interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse\ncontrol, supports all major operating systems, and enables the parallel\nexecution of multiple environment instances, making it particularly well-suited\nfor evaluating the most capable foundation agents, powered by multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs). Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs agents\ndemonstrate substantial limitations, with the best-performing model, GPT-4.1,\nachieving only a 12.7% success rate, primarily due to challenges in visual\nunderstanding, multimodal reasoning and low-level manipulation.

This study utilizes a non-annotated skin\nlesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed\nimaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and\ncolor palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and\ntrained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using\ncustom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is\ndeveloped to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed\nDCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection\nmodels across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of\n85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive\ndataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and\n90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)\nalgorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making\nprocess regarding BWV detection.

      "abstract": "With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor\nenvironments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized\nfor challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades\nimage quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face\nimage restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)\nand diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due\nto the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced\ndegradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework\nthat integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature\nTransformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The\nlocal SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the\nlocal statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those\nof high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables\nrobust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions\nby aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration\nprocess adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,\nparticularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing\nfacial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically\nvalidated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face\nrestoration under challenging weather scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Current 4D Gaussian frameworks for dynamic scene reconstruction deliver\nimpressive visual fidelity and rendering speed, however, the inherent trade-off\nbetween storage costs and the ability to characterize complex physical motions\nsignificantly limits the practical application of these methods. To tackle\nthese problems, we propose SD-GS, a compact and efficient dynamic Gaussian\nsplatting framework for complex dynamic scene reconstruction, featuring two key\ncontributions. First, we introduce a deformable anchor grid, a hierarchical and\nmemory-efficient scene representation where each anchor point derives multiple\n3D Gaussians in its local spatiotemporal region and serves as the geometric\nbackbone of the 3D scene. Second, to enhance modeling capability for complex\nmotions, we present a deformation-aware densification strategy that adaptively\ngrows anchors in under-reconstructed high-dynamic regions while reducing\nredundancy in static areas, achieving superior visual quality with fewer\nanchors. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, SD-GS achieves an average of 60\\% reduction in model size and an\naverage of 100\\% improvement in FPS, significantly enhancing computational\nefficiency while maintaining or even surpassing visual quality.",

      "abstract": "With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,\nYouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).\nHowever, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as\nmany private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models\nwithout authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first\ninvestigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation\nby deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use\nprimarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly\napplying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,\nlimited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable\nExamples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on\nlarge-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on\nunlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure\nand thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of\nTUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the\nlearning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance\nin video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT\nmodels, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.",

Unlike prior methods that mitigate\nnegative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely\nin token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter\ngrowth.

      "abstract": "The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of\natherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic\nfeatures, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is\nimportant. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of\nlabeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these\nproblems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to\neffectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid\nartery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:\na coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some\nprior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a\nfine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To\neffectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,\nwe investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level\nmulti-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of\nlimited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a\nsemi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input\ntransformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with\narteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion\npoint selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our\nresults, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our\nfindings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised\nlearning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI\napplications.",

Inspired by the recent advancements of\nlanguage models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the\nmodels by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment\nfrom a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference\noptimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking\noptimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference\nOptimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion\nmodels by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the\nsame optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to\njustify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to\nvalidate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic\nmetrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO\ncan consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically\noutperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in\nPickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's\nsuperiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO\nunlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging\nprincipled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.",

Existing methods typically represent\nthe human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic\nphysical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and\nmakes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we\npropose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human\ntopology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To\npreserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial\nfield for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal\ndependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.\nInter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the\ndependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant\nmultilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group\nthrough parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical\nplausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion\npriors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,\nincluding Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and\nsuperiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in\nshort-term motion prediction.

These approaches demonstrate efficacy in\na range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D\nobject segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the\nabsence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video\ndataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for\ntraining and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world\nscenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor\nactivities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from\nvarious types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a\nmaximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with\ntheir corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of\ninterest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view\nor across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which\ncontains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for\nthe evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an\nevaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and\nevaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new\nbenchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view\nimages selected from our MUVOD dataset.

      "abstract": "Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation\nfields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical\nspatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent\nin neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current\nmethods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,\noften resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit\ntechniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node\ninitialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for\ninterpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the\nnumber of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach\nenables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial\ncoherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model\nknot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel\nlow-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled\nspatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in\ntemporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.\nFurthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without\nrelying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.",

      "abstract": "Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,\nwildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully\nchoose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.\nRecent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision\nmodels on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend\nto focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For\nmany important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application\nmodalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation\nmodels makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small\ndatasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing\nfoundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on\nmulti-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing\nmechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a\nspecific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only\nretains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient\nmodality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the\nmodalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote\nsensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised\ntraining and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models.

NCV achieves this by utilizing\nrecent minimally supervised concept discovery models to extract structured\nconcept encodings from raw inputs. A prover then selects a subset of these\nencodings, which a verifier -- implemented as a nonlinear predictor -- uses\nexclusively for decision-making. Our evaluations show that NCV outperforms CBM\nand pixel-based PVG classifier baselines on high-dimensional, logically complex\ndatasets and also helps mitigate shortcut behavior.

Prior work in this\ncontext has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from\nopen-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval\nchallenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with\npretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study\nArabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from\nreal-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of\nlanguages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently\nand uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual\nretrieval behavior.\n  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual\ndomain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when\nthe user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that\nthese failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking\ndocuments across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy\nthat addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both\nlanguages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall\nperformance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving\nmultilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.",

      "abstract": "What algorithms do LLMs actually learn and use to solve problems? Studies\naddressing this question are sparse, as research priorities are focused on\nimproving performance through scale, leaving a theoretical and empirical gap in\nunderstanding emergent algorithms. This position paper proposes AlgEval: a\nframework for systematic research into the algorithms that LLMs learn and use.\nAlgEval aims to uncover algorithmic primitives, reflected in latent\nrepresentations, attention, and inference-time compute, and their algorithmic\ncomposition to solve task-specific problems. We highlight potential\nmethodological paths and a case study toward this goal, focusing on emergent\nsearch algorithms. Our case study illustrates both the formation of top-down\nhypotheses about candidate algorithms, and bottom-up tests of these hypotheses\nvia circuit-level analysis of attention patterns and hidden states. The\nrigorous, systematic evaluation of how LLMs actually solve tasks provides an\nalternative to resource-intensive scaling, reorienting the field toward a\nprincipled understanding of underlying computations. Such algorithmic\nexplanations offer a pathway to human-understandable interpretability, enabling\ncomprehension of the model's internal reasoning performance measures. This can\nin turn lead to more sample-efficient methods for training and improving\nperformance, as well as novel architectures for end-to-end and multi-agent\nsystems.",

A VLM\n(InternVL2) generated catalogue descriptions for photographic prints on\nlabelled cardboard mounts with archaeological content, evaluated by archive and\narchaeology experts and non-experts in a human-centered, experimental\nframework.

Classification performance was above chance level, with both groups\nunderestimating their ability to detect Al-generated descriptions. OCR errors\nand hallucinations limited perceived quality, yet descriptions rated higher in\naccuracy and usefulness were harder to classify, suggesting that human review\nis necessary to ensure the accuracy and quality of catalogue descriptions\ngenerated by the out-of-the-box model, particularly in specialized domains like\narchaeological cataloguing. Experts showed lower willingness to adopt AI tools,\nemphasizing concerns on preservation responsibility over technical performance.\nThese findings advocate for a collaborative approach where AI supports draft\ngeneration but remains subordinate to human verification, ensuring alignment\nwith curatorial values (e.g., provenance, transparency).

The\nrequired intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways\nsuffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires\nadapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,\nwe find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.\nHowever, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly\nimproving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats\ndespite its embeddings remaining well separated.

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel few-shot cross-domain anomaly detection\nframework, Nexus Vision Transformer for Anomaly Detection (NexViTAD), based on\nvision foundation models, which effectively addresses domain-shift challenges\nin industrial anomaly detection through innovative shared subspace projection\nmechanisms and multi-task learning (MTL) module. The main innovations include:\n(1) a hierarchical adapter module that adaptively fuses complementary features\nfrom Hiera and DINO-v2 pre-trained models, constructing more robust feature\nrepresentations; (2) a shared subspace projection strategy that enables\neffective cross-domain knowledge transfer through bottleneck dimension\nconstraints and skip connection mechanisms; (3) a MTL Decoder architecture\nsupports simultaneous processing of multiple source domains, significantly\nenhancing model generalization capabilities; (4) an anomaly score inference\nmethod based on Sinkhorn-K-means clustering, combined with Gaussian filtering\nand adaptive threshold processing for precise pixel level. Valuated on the\nMVTec AD dataset, NexViTAD delivers state-of-the-art performance with an AUC of\n97.5%, AP of 70.4%, and PRO of 95.2% in the target domains, surpassing other\nrecent models, marking a transformative advance in cross-domain defect\ndetection.",

      "abstract": "Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant\nsocial and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and\ndepth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often\ntrade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge\nthis gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a\nplug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and\na dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D\nflood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to\nmultispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer\nmodel to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without\nchanging the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is\nbased on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the\n2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood\nboundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case\nstudy on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled\nwith SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\\%. The resulting\n3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These\nresults demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps\nsuitable for rapid disaster response.",

Building on this\ninsight, we introduce an inference-time ensemble that runs K independent\ndenoising passes and aggregates both posterior means and variances without any\nextra training. On WikiText-2, our MC-marginal sampler recovers the analytic\nlambda-DCE zero-shot perplexity (approximately 39) to within a few points at\nK=128, and its per-token variance shows a strong rank correlation with\nreconstruction error (Spearman rho = 0.996).

To optimize this\nmodel, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of\npose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and\ntemporal attention training.

To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a\ncomprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks\nacross 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems.

SpatialVizBench\nempirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit\ndeficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant\nlacuna in the field.

We introduce ViLU, a new\nVision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes\nuncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.\nViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating\nthe visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned\ntextual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based\non loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier\nto distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary\ncross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed\napproach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text\nembeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive\nexperiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method\ncompared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to\nstandard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale\nimage-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M.

      "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is establishing itself as an important,\nlow-cost, noninvasive diagnostic tool for the early detection of Parkinson's\nDisease (PD). In this context, EEG-based Deep Learning (DL) models have shown\npromising results due to their ability to discover highly nonlinear patterns\nwithin the signal. However, current state-of-the-art DL models suffer from poor\ngeneralizability caused by high inter-subject variability. This high\nvariability underscores the need for enhancing model generalizability by\ndeveloping new architectures better tailored to EEG data. This paper introduces\nTransformEEG, a hybrid Convolutional-Transformer designed for Parkinson's\ndisease detection using EEG data. Unlike transformer models based on the EEGNet\nstructure, TransformEEG incorporates a depthwise convolutional tokenizer. This\ntokenizer is specialized in generating tokens composed by channel-specific\nfeatures, which enables more effective feature mixing within the self-attention\nlayers of the transformer encoder. To evaluate the proposed model, four public\ndatasets comprising 290 subjects (140 PD patients, 150 healthy controls) were\nharmonized and aggregated. A 10-outer, 10-inner Nested-Leave-N-Subjects-Out\n(N-LNSO) cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased comparison\nagainst seven other consolidated EEG deep learning models. TransformEEG\nachieved the highest balanced accuracy's median (78.45%) as well as the lowest\ninterquartile range (6.37%) across all the N-LNSO partitions. When combined\nwith data augmentation and threshold correction, median accuracy increased to\n80.10%, with an interquartile range of 5.74%. In conclusion, TransformEEG\nproduces more consistent and less skewed results. It demonstrates a substantial\nreduction in variability and more reliable PD detection using EEG data compared\nto the other investigated models.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging\nparadigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate\nreconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong\ngenerative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain\nspecificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on\nhigh-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and\nresults in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose\na Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC\nemploys a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge\nlow-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting\npixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic\nimportance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving\ncritical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating\ntrajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a\ntraining-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible\nmotion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative\nmodels. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both\ntraditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods\nunder ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our\napproach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided\nmethods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided\nby geometric motion modeling.",

      "abstract": "Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have\nachieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often\nexhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can\ncompromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular\nfocus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition\nperformance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and\nwhether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)\ntechniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and\nattention patterns, especially for \"neutral\", \"sadness\", and \"anger\" in elderly\nindividuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias\nmitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted\nLoss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with\nautomatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets\nthat include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements\nin recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most\nerror-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained\nwith age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age\ngroup, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest\nthat age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training\nmodifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for\npromoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.",

Our results across a variety of frontier open-source and commercial\nLLMs show that while models may succeed in shallow queries, they often fail to\nsimulate physical constraints, preserve spatial coherence, or generalize under\nlayout perturbation. PlanQA uncovers a clear blind spot in today's LLMs: they\ndo not consistently reason about real-world layouts.

Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by\nrelying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various\ndrugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while\noverlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more\nsuitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules\ncan trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates\nthat the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This\npaper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic\ncell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP\nframework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular\nlatent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP\nto optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the\nMitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%\nin mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Matching theoretical predictions to experimental data remains a central\nchallenge in hadron spectroscopy. In particular, the identification of new\nhadronic states is difficult, as exotic signals near threshold can arise from a\nvariety of physical mechanisms. A key diagnostic in this context is the pole\nstructure of the scattering amplitude, but different configurations can produce\nsimilar signatures. The mapping between pole configurations and line shapes is\nespecially ambiguous near the mass threshold, where analytic control is\nlimited. In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware machine learning\napproach for classifying pole structures in $S$-matrix elements. Our method is\nbased on an ensemble of classifier chains that provide both epistemic and\naleatoric uncertainty estimates. We apply a rejection criterion based on\npredictive uncertainty, achieving a validation accuracy of nearly $95\\%$ while\ndiscarding only a small fraction of high-uncertainty predictions. Trained on\nsynthetic data with known pole structures, the model generalizes to previously\nunseen experimental data, including enhancements associated with the\n$P_{c\\bar{c}}(4312)^+$ state observed by LHCb. In this, we infer a four-pole\nstructure, representing the presence of a genuine compact pentaquark in the\npresence of a higher channel virtual state pole with non-vanishing width. While\nevaluated on this particular state, our framework is broadly applicable to\nother candidate hadronic states and offers a scalable tool for pole structure\ninference in scattering amplitudes.",

Our research aims to\npredict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical\nvertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We\naccomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation\n(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians\nwith a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for\northodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial\naspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the\ncervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To\nmitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a\nuser-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the\nannotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,\nwhich adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,\ncoupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural\nconsistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual\neffort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and\naccuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet\ndemonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in\nmedical imaging.

      "abstract": "Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of\nresearch that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.\nWhile previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a\ndeep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial\nExpression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates\nAU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.\nIn particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different\nexpressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a\npriori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning\noutcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU\nloss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic\nexpression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted\non three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal\ndatasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture\noutperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional\narithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate\nthe potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance\nissues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression\nknowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label\nimbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a\ndiverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.\nThis underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in\nmainstream datasets within this domain.

      "abstract": "Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to\nestimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by\nlight absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,\nMamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision\ntasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state\nscanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images\neffectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth\nlabels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater\nimages and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we\ndevelop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating\naccurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we\npropose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum\nspanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features\namong the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and\ntop-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation\ncapabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark\n(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with\nreliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for\ntraining existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate\nobject-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority\nof the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative\nresults and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.\nCode and dataset will be available at https://wyjgr.github.io/Tree-Mamba.html.",

      "abstract": "Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many\nfine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational\ncost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and\ncomplexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is\nneeded. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by\nstoring external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to\nsupport question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face\nsignificant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper\nintroduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome\nthese limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG\nintegrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text\nsummarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework\nalso includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,\nsignificantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the\nMultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document\ncorpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable\nimprovements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest\nmean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile\n(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.\nIn addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The\nsummarization step reduced the average training time of individual components\nby 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge\ngraph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,\nrequiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested\nin this study.",

This instruction-based\ncontrol mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs\nmust remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be\nunpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we\nintroduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with\nGPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial\nattacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change\nobjective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across\nfour downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures\nsimultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous\nevaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present\nCRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an\nefficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and\nother popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing\napproaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted\nobject-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially\ninfluencing unified VLMs across diverse tasks.",

Among various\napproaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate\nforgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.\nHowever, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within\nthe replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and\nnewly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing\ndata replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination\nmechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning\nobjective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has\ntwo key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs\nglobal representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then\nguides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve\nbalanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the\ntask aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of\nlogits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces\nthe model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity\nto minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves\nbalanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and\nimproves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,\nyielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.",

At\neach stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the\ncables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by\ndetecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or\ncable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using\nonly motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive,\nunsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models\n(GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a\nbrief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on\nknown anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using\nMahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds\ntriggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the\nlatest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions.\nValidation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind\nintensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4%\naverage true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative\nevaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates\nhigher robustness to drift and environmental variation.",

Despite its empirical success, the theoretical\nproperties and intrinsic limitations of DPO remain underexplored. In this work,\nwe first present a comprehensive analysis of DPO's dynamics from a probability\nevolution perspective. Our analysis reveals that DPO is highly sensitive to\ninitialization. It also tends to misallocate probability mass, which can\ninadvertently shift probability toward irrelevant or undesired responses. This\nmisallocation may unintentionally reinforce model bias, thereby compromising\nboth the stability of model alignment and the consistency with intended\npreferences. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a\ntheoretically grounded bilevel optimization framework that tightly integrate\nsupervised fine-tuning with an enhanced DPO objective a.k.a. stable preference\noptimization. Our approach introduces a principled regularization scheme to\nexplicitly encourage absolute probability improvement for preferred outputs,\nwhile maintaining stable optimization dynamics.

This\npaper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact\ntokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability\ndifferences between the current policy and a reference model.

      "abstract": "The first violins appeared in late 16th-century Italy. Over the next 200\nyears, they spread across Europe and luthiers of various royal courts, eager to\nexperiment with new techniques, created a highly diverse family of instruments.\nAround 1750, size standards were introduced to unify violin making for\norchestras and conservatories. Instruments that fell between two standards were\nthen reduced to a smaller size by luthiers. These reductions have an impact on\nseveral characteristics of violins, in particular on the contour lines, i.e.\nlines of constant altitude, which look more like a U for non reduced\ninstruments and a V for reduced ones. While such differences are observed by\nexperts, they have not been studied quantitatively.\n  This paper presents a method for classifying violins as reduced or\nnon-reduced based on their contour lines. We study a corpus of 25 instruments\nwhose 3D geometric meshes were acquired via photogrammetry. For each\ninstrument, we extract 10-20 contour lines regularly spaced every millimetre.\nEach line is fitted with a parabola-like curve (with an equation of the type y\n= alpha*abs(x)**beta) depending on two parameters, describing how open (beta)\nand how vertically stretched (alpha) the curve is. We compute additional\nfeatures from those parameters, using regressions and counting how many values\nfall under some threshold. We also deal with outliers and non equal numbers of\nlevels, and eventually obtain a numerical profile for each instrument.\n  We then apply classification methods to assess whether geometry alone can\npredict size reduction. We find that distinguishing between reduced and non\nreduced instruments is feasible to some degree, taking into account that a\nwhole spectrum of more or less transformed violins exists, for which it is more\ndifficult to quantify the reduction. We also find the opening parameter beta to\nbe the most predictive.",

      "abstract": "Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight\nDetection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on\nfinal-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their\nadaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has\nemerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem\nfrom a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse\nnature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),\nthe first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the\nReference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the\ncontext modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing\nanchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration\nof InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound\nimplications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves\nexisting ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on\nQVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter\ncount w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods.

Quantitative fluorescence requires\npaired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light)\nmode.

It pioneers an innovative dual\nlens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional\nontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary\nbreakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such\nas contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional\nlimitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence\nreasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning\nformalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text\nprocessing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical\ninnovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts\narchitectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical\nchallenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation\ndifficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that\nmaps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin\nargumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,\nprediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including\nlow-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal\nhandling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for\nresearchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the\nalgorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal\nartificial intelligence.

Existing\nunlearning methods tend to forget shallowly: phenomenon of an unlearned model\npretend to forget by adjusting only the model response, while its internal\nrepresentations retain information sufficiently to restore the forgotten data\nor behavior. We empirically confirm the widespread shallowness by reverting the\nforgetting effect of various unlearning methods via training-free performance\nrecovery attack and gradient-inversion-based data reconstruction attack. To\naddress this vulnerability fundamentally, we define a theoretical criterion of\n``deep forgetting'' based on one-point-contraction of feature representations\nof data to forget. We also propose an efficient approximation algorithm, and\nuse it to construct a novel general-purpose unlearning algorithm:\nOne-Point-Contraction (OPC). Empirical evaluations on image classification\nunlearning benchmarks show that OPC achieves not only effective unlearning\nperformance but also superior resilience against both performance recovery\nattack and gradient-inversion attack. The distinctive unlearning performance of\nOPC arises from the deep feature forgetting enforced by its theoretical\nfoundation, and recaps the need for improved robustness of machine unlearning\nmethods.",

      "abstract": "Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial\napplications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.\nGeometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the\nlife and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can\nbe quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the\ncomputer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)\ngeometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the\ntwo modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference\ndeformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of\nhigh-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we\npresent a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations\nbetween CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing\nstrategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we\nintroduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches\nbetween binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the\nregistration. Our approach shows a 9.2\\% improvement in the Dice Score and a\n9.9\\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,\nwhile reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the\nfoundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes\nthat can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production\nprocess. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the\nmanufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and\nmaterial.",

However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training\nobjective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise\nvulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well\ndistinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while\nclasses with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain\ndisproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong\nclasses do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust\nfeatures are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from\nstronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by\nthis, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that\nadaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting\nfeature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted\nadversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further\nincorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,\nbuilding on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.\nComprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,\nincluding evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,\ndemonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both\nclean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and\npreserves overall accuracy.

      "abstract": "Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without\nbeing constrained by $\\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,\nfor example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent\ntraditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or\ncertified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there\nare also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human\nevaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While\nsome related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none\nprovide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified\nframework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and\ncomparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an\nopen-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted\nadversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for\ncrowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure\nimperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison\nacross 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three\ndiffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we\nfound that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it\nonly consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested\nattacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task\ntemplate to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an\nImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial\nexamples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated\nvision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a\nground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.",

Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by\nusing an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by\ndistribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when\nmodels are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional\nTTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation\nsteps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the\nrequirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach\ncalled Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the\nconcurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that\npredicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks\nduring test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional\nmulti-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our\nempirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across\nvarious benchmarks.",

We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their\ninteractions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label\nsmoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different\nclassification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)\nsimultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the\nbest calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc\ncalibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data\n(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration\nmethods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not\nnecessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration\nmethods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of\nworsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for\nrandomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from\nfoundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to\nmodels trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of\nensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling\n(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for\nensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,\n(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve\ncalibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,\nyields best calibration results overall.",

      "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that imaging systems can be evaluated through\nthe information content of their measurements alone, enabling\napplication-agnostic optical design that avoids computational decoding\nchallenges. Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) was proposed\nto automate this process through gradient-based optimization. In this work, we\nstudy IDEAL across diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high\nmemory usage, long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function\ndue to end-to-end differentiability requirements. We introduce IDEAL with\nInterchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO), a method that decouples density\nestimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating between fitting\nmodels to current measurements and updating optical parameters using fixed\nmodels for information estimation. This approach reduces runtime and memory\nusage by up to 6x while enabling more expressive density models that guide\noptimization toward superior designs. We validate our method on diffractive\noptics, lensless imaging, and snapshot 3D microscopy applications, establishing\ninformation-theoretic optimization as a practical, scalable strategy for\nreal-world imaging system design.",

To address this challenge, we propose Visual\nInstance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts\nbased on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,\nleveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting\ninformation. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two\ncorner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to\neffectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension\nreduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,\nViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level\nknowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to\nVPT-Deep.

      "abstract": "Segmenting curvilinear structures in fluorescence microscopy remains a\nchallenging task, particularly under noisy conditions and in dense filament\nnetworks commonly seen in vivo. To address this, we created two original\ndatasets consisting of hundreds of synthetic images of fluorescently labelled\nmicrotubules within cells. These datasets are precisely annotated and closely\nmimic real microscopy images, including realistic noise. The second dataset\npresents an additional challenge, by simulating varying fluorescence\nintensities along filaments that complicate segmentation. While deep learning\nhas shown strong potential in biomedical image analysis, its performance often\ndeclines in noisy or low-contrast conditions. To overcome this limitation, we\ndeveloped a novel advanced architecture: the Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation\nResidual U-Net (ASE_Res_UNet). This model enhanced the standard U-Net by\nintegrating residual blocks in the encoder and adaptive SE attention mechanisms\nin the decoder. Through ablation studies and comprehensive visual and\nquantitative evaluations, ASE_Res_UNet consistently outperformed its variants,\nnamely standard U-Net, ASE_UNet and Res_UNet architectures. These improvements,\nparticularly in noise resilience and detecting fine, low-intensity structures,\nwere largely attributed to the adaptive SE attention module that we created. We\nfurther benchmarked ASE_Res_UNet against various state-of-the-art models, and\nfound it achieved superior performance on our most challenging dataset.\nFinally, the model also generalized well to real microscopy images of stained\nmicrotubules as well as to other curvilinear structures. Indeed, it\nsuccessfully segmented retinal blood vessels and nerves in noisy or\nlow-contrast biomedical images, demonstrating its strong potential for\napplications in disease diagnosis and treatment.",

Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle\nthis issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:\n(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data\nconditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable\nperformance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,\nwe propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual\nrecognition with missing modalities.

However, to translate the optimal continuous\nrepresentation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.\nWe tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to\ninvert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a\npowerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying\nover time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary\nfrom STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate\nvalid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the\nlogic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given\nembedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting\nwhile remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show\nthe effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae\ncomplexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to\neffectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and\ngeneralize out-of-distribution.

      "abstract": "Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for\nprecise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods\nmostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored\nin this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.\n  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung\ntumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are\nevaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)\napproach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)\nmodel designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the\nlimited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment\nsessions.\n  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning\n4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was\nheld out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's\nplanning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion\nover a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement\nError (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and\ntreatment (T2) data.\n  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set\nsizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,\nMP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical\nvariability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.\n  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless\ntumor motion forecasting.

      "abstract": "Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that\nenables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite\nits significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss\nfunction used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the\nconventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on\nresponse tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction\ntuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of\ndifferentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,\nand propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to\nconventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language\nmodels of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different\nsizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard\ninstruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited\nrobustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight\nfor prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens\nyields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better\nstarting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These\nfindings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer\nactionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models.

      "abstract": "Recent studies show large language models (LLMs) and vision language models\n(VLMs) trained using web-scale data can empower end-to-end autonomous driving\nsystems for a better generalization and interpretation. Specifically, by\ndynamically routing inputs to specialized subsets of parameters, the\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique enables general LLMs or VLMs to achieve\nsubstantial performance improvements while maintaining computational\nefficiency. However, general MoE models usually demands extensive training data\nand complex optimization. In this work, inspired by the learning process of\nhuman drivers, we propose a skill-oriented MoE, called MoSE, which mimics human\ndrivers' learning process and reasoning process, skill-by-skill and\nstep-by-step. We propose a skill-oriented routing mechanism that begins with\ndefining and annotating specific skills, enabling experts to identify the\nnecessary driving competencies for various scenarios and reasoning tasks,\nthereby facilitating skill-by-skill learning. Further align the driving process\nto multi-step planning in human reasoning and end-to-end driving models, we\nbuild a hierarchical skill dataset and pretrain the router to encourage the\nmodel to think step-by-step. Unlike multi-round dialogs, MoSE integrates\nvaluable auxiliary tasks (e.g.\\ description, reasoning, planning) in one single\nforward process without introducing any extra computational cost. With less\nthan 3B sparsely activated parameters, our model outperforms several 8B+\nparameters on CODA AD corner case reasoning task. Compared to existing methods\nbased on open-source models and data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with significantly reduced activated model size (at least by\n$62.5\\%$) with a single-turn conversation.",

Inspired by\nbiological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input\n(e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)--we advocate for adaptive\nsensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively\nmodulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitivity, multimodal\nconfigurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts\nand improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demonstrates\nthat adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass\nsubstantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more\ndata and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive\nsensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous\nsystems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess\ntechnical and ethical integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted\nresearch directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive\nalgorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods.\nCollectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward\nsustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.",

To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which\nmitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often\ndecouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,\nhowever, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of\nplasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct\nan in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly\naggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks\nthrough simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple\nyet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image\nfeatures for query assignment, ensuring \"perfect alignment\" to preserve\nobjectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to\npromote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we\nintroduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative \"visual\nquery\"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,\nsettings, splits, and input data orders.

      "abstract": "Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the\nmanufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the\nmanufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector.\nState-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive\nperformance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world\nmanufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets\nrepresentative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,\nhigh-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and\ntypically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address\nthis, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for\nhigh-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution\nscans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging\nsensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,\ncovering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures\nan additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range\nof relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM\nis captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position\nand orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as\npartial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly\ndetection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to\ncurrent approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality\nof the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry\npartners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate\nthe development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the\ndemands of modern manufacturing environments.",

      "abstract": "Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)\nremains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,\npathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which\nrely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,\noften fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in\nsuboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations\nby proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,\nincluding CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and\ngenomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance\nclinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive\ndataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,\nand CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are\nemployed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while\nMeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For\nstructured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.\nThese models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each\nmodality, which are then fused through an early and late integration\narchitecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary\ninformation from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to\nhandle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling\ninference even when certain modalities are missing.",

However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by\ncoreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that\ndisrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how\nentity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance\nin RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual\nunderstanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference\nresolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering\n(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies\nin retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context\ncapturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we\ndiscover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,\nlikely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential\nambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper\nunderstanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,\nproviding guidance for improving retrieval and generation in\nknowledge-intensive AI applications.",

It has helped improve the\nperformance, reliability, and interpretability of machine learning models.\nHowever, recent literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has\nfaced criticism. The classical XAI and causality literature focuses on\nunderstanding which factors contribute to which consequences. While such\nknowledge is valuable for researchers and engineers, it is not what non-expert\nusers expect as explanations. Instead, these users often await facts that cause\nthe target consequences, i.e., actual causes. Formalizing this notion is still\nan open problem. Additionally, identifying actual causes is reportedly an\nNP-complete problem, and there are too few practical solutions to approximate\nformal definitions. We propose a set of algorithms to identify actual causes\nwith a polynomial complexity and an adjustable level of precision and\nexhaustiveness. Our experiments indicate that the algorithms (1) identify\ncauses for different categories of systems that are not handled by existing\napproaches (i.e., non-boolean, black-box, and stochastic systems), (2) can be\nadjusted to gain more precision and exhaustiveness with more computation time.",

      "abstract": "Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many\nconcurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in\ndigital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to\nserve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of\ndownstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking\navailable methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research\nlandscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark\nshould not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide\ninsights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further\nconsider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed\nmodels. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for\ndigital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many\nmodels on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their\nfeature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions\ninformed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark\nthat can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as\nwell as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this\npaper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16\ndifferent datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.\nThe code for THUNDER is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/MICS-Lab/thunder.",

We\nformalize this through a composite operator $\\phi(\\cdot, \\gamma(\\cdot))$ where\n$\\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\\gamma$ resolves local\nsub-games.

Our\nverification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to\ntransfinite contexts, a novel $\\phi$-topology based on the\nKozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and\ncategorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions\nas a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI\nembedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the \"semantic virus\" concept\nit theorizes.

      "abstract": "Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,\nand appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool\nin applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater\nconstruction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image\nrestoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited\ndepth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate\nunrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and\nsignificant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by\ncombining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data\ngeneration pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --\nwhich encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an\nexplicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the\neffects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a\nphysics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and\nrealistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image\ndatasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with\ndense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on\nboth synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art\nperformance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based\nmethods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It\nalso offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project\nwebsite https://tianfwang.github.io/slurpp/.",

While compatible with low-power\nmicrocontrollers (MCUs), structured pruning underutilizes the opportunity for\nfine-grained efficiency on devices without SIMD support or parallel compute. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce UnIT (Unstructured Inference-Time\npruning), a lightweight method that dynamically identifies and skips\nunnecessary multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations during inference, guided by\ninput-specific activation patterns. Unlike structured pruning, UnIT embraces\nirregular sparsity and does not require retraining or hardware specialization.\nIt transforms pruning decisions into lightweight comparisons, replacing\nmultiplications with threshold checks and approximated divisions. UnIT further\noptimizes compute by reusing threshold computations across multiple connections\nand applying layer- and group-specific pruning sensitivity. We present three\nfast, hardware-friendly division approximations tailored to the capabilities of\ncommon embedded platforms. Demonstrated on the MSP430 microcontroller, UnIT\nachieves 11.02% to 82.03% MAC reduction, 27.30% to 84.19% faster inference, and\n27.33% to 84.38% lower energy consumption compared to training-time pruned\nmodels, while maintaining accuracy with 0.48-7%.

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced\nAI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent\nresponses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but\nit presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical\ninformation, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading\ncontent, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially\nprovides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual\nerrors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent\nRetrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual\naccuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated\nRethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of\nretrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework\nintegrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite\nmodule for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to\neffectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our\nevaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks\ndemonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall\nperformance, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

Although various\ndomain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the\nadaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,\nconsiderations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation\nrestrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a\nnovel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this\nwork. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our\nobservations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the\nfrequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time\ndomain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and\ninconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based\nself-supervised\n\\textbf{C}onsistency-\\textbf{i}n\\textbf{C}onsistency-\\textbf{i}ntegration\n(\\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.\nBesides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism\nto mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation\nacross instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under\nthe TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,\npresenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation\nwithout accessing source data.

Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance\nAngiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,\nhowever, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,\noverlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular\nchanges. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and\nmorphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face\nchallenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and\nlack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel\nsemi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based\ntoolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,\nachieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with\nminimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based\nlandmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively\naddressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human\nsubjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved\nsensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing\nsemi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative\nfeature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework\nutilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for\nspecific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for\nbenchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into\nclinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and\nstandardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of\nvascular contributions to brain health.",

      "abstract": "Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate\ndata collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.\nResearchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization\nof disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and\nphysiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse\nmetrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,\nhigh mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we\ndevelop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID\npredictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by\ncameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object\ntracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a\ntransformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator\nlinear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our\nmodels assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second\nwith 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline\nimproves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and\nvarious environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.",

Traditional training relies\nheavily on expert coaching, but recent advances in AI has led to novel types of\ncommercial automated public speaking feedback tools. However, most research has\nfocused on prototypes rather than commercial applications, and little is known\nabout how public speaking experts perceive these tools.\n  Objectives: This study aims to evaluate expert opinions on the efficacy and\ndesign of commercial AI-based public speaking training tools and to propose\nguidelines for their improvement.\n  Methods: The research involved 16 semi-structured interviews and 2 focus\ngroups with public speaking experts. Participants discussed their views on\ncurrent commercial tools, their potential integration into traditional\ncoaching, and suggestions for enhancing these systems.\n  Results and Conclusions: Experts acknowledged the value of AI tools in\nhandling repetitive, technical aspects of training, allowing coaches to focus\non higher-level skills. However they found key issues in current tools,\nemphasising the need for personalised, understandable, carefully selected\nfeedback and clear instructional design. Overall, they supported a hybrid model\ncombining traditional coaching with AI-supported exercises.",

This paper argues that, contrary\nto prevailing intuition, the diminishing returns to compute scaling will lead\nto a convergence of AI model capabilities. In other words, meek models (those\nwith limited computation budget) shall inherit the earth, approaching the\nperformance level of the best models overall. We develop a model illustrating\nthat under a fixed-distribution next-token objective, the marginal capability\nreturns to raw compute shrink substantially. Given current scaling practices,\nwe argue that these diminishing returns are strong enough that even companies\nthat can scale their models exponentially faster than other organizations will\neventually have little advantage in capabilities. As part of our argument, we\ngive several reasons that proxies like training loss differences capture\nimportant capability measures using evidence from benchmark data and\ntheoretical performance models. In addition, we analyze empirical data on the\ncapability difference of AI models over time. Finally, in light of the\nincreasing ability of meek models, we argue that AI strategy and policy require\nreexamination, and we outline the areas this shift will affect.",

While these techniques already establish\nthat data from the training set can be reconstructed, they often rely on\nhigh-resources, excess to the training set as well as well-engineered and\ndesigned prompts.\n  In this work, we devise a new attack that requires low resources, assumes\nlittle to no access to the actual training set, and identifies, seemingly,\nbenign prompts that lead to potentially-risky image reconstruction. This\nhighlights the risk that images might even be reconstructed by an uninformed\nuser and unintentionally. For example, we identified that, with regard to one\nexisting model, the prompt ``blue Unisex T-Shirt'' can generate the face of a\nreal-life human model.

      "abstract": "Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,\nexisting solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly\nscoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,\nand reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we\nintroduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future\nof AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language\nmodels to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to\nembrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful\nin real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured\nmemory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and\nKnowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls\nand coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,\nreason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We\nvalidate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a\nchallenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution\ncomputer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and\nwhere no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher\naccuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.\nSecond, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual\ninput, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing\nexisting baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance\nstandard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our\nmemory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors\nthe screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers\nintuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.",

In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves\nstrong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.0% and 70.7% accuracy on\nVideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently\noutperforming LongVILA-R1 across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1\nshows steady performance improvements as the number of input video frames\nincreases. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video\nRL training. In addition, we release our training system for public\navailability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and\naudio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video\ngeneration models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on\nhour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k tokens).",

Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain\ncentral challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data\nshould be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is\nthat action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where\nsequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each\ntimestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to\nmitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by\ndirectly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1)\nleverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective\nonline exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and\nefficient TD learning.

Towards a fundamental understanding\nof the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate\nthe root cause of this gap.

However,\nour analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video\ndata often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their\nlearned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and\nthe underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a\nsimple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to\ninternalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's\nintermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them\nwith features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we\nintroduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which\nenforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,\nwhich preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric\nfeatures from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing\non both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves visual\nquality and 3D consistency over the baseline methods.

While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline\nsettings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the\nperspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect\nemphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired\nobservations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current\nvisual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.\nOST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.\nBuilt on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k\nscenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and\nARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that\nthey fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the\nonline setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and\nthe memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common\nerror patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial\nreasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly\ndrop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core\nchallenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning.

Despite their popularity, their representations show major\nlimitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,\nas a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of \"a yellow\nsubmarine and a blue bus\" or \"a blue submarine and a yellow bus\". Previous\nattempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the\narchitecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect\nthat the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in\nthe arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this\nwork, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data\nproperties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We\nfind that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,\nincomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to\ndescribe the object that is \"most salient\" to them have a detrimental effect on\nbinding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling\nthe batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly\ncreating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the\ndata expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect\nbinding.",

Training\nexpressive policy classes with online RL present a unique challenge of stable\nvalue maximization. Unlike simpler Gaussian policies commonly used in online\nRL, expressive policies like diffusion and flow-matching policies are\nparameterized by a long denoising chain, which hinders stable gradient\npropagation from actions to policy parameters when optimizing against some\nvalue function. Our key insight is that we can address stable value\nmaximization by avoiding direct optimization over value with the expressive\npolicy and instead construct an on-the-fly RL policy to maximize Q-value. We\npropose Expressive Policy Optimization (EXPO), a sample-efficient online RL\nalgorithm that utilizes an on-the-fly policy to maximize value with two\nparameterized policies -- a larger expressive base policy trained with a stable\nimitation learning objective and a light-weight Gaussian edit policy that edits\nthe actions sampled from the base policy toward a higher value distribution.\nThe on-the-fly policy optimizes the actions from the base policy with the\nlearned edit policy and chooses the value maximizing action from the base and\nedited actions for both sampling and temporal-difference (TD) backup. Our\napproach yields up to 2-3x improvement in sample efficiency on average over\nprior methods both in the setting of fine-tuning a pretrained policy given\noffline data and in leveraging offline data to train online.",

For the\nstructural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based\nmetrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,\nanchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the\nsemantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing\nobjects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,\nenabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth\nstimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple\nstimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.\nTogether, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and\ncomprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.",

In\ncontrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length\nrepresentations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or\nfamiliarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating\nvariable-length representations but typically require test-time search over\nmultiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov\nComplexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which\npredicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward\npass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a\nproxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely\nresembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to\nconditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.\nKARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a\nsingle pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of\nencoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.\nAdditionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive\nImage Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted\nimage complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.\nout-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.",

To\nnarrow this gap, we propose MGVQ, a novel method to augment the representation\ncapability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier optimization for\ncodebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing reconstruction\nquality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension to preserve\nencoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for quantization.\nFurthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks featuring\nresolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance of\nexisting methods rigorously. MGVQ achieves the state-of-the-art performance on\nboth ImageNet and 8 zero-shot benchmarks across all VQ-VAEs. Notably, compared\nwith SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly, with rFID 0.49 v.s.\n0.91, and achieve superior PSNR on all zero-shot benchmarks. These results\nhighlight the superiority of MGVQ in reconstruction and pave the way for\npreserving fidelity in HD image processing tasks.

To bridge this\ngap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a\ndiagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception\nof subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box\nevaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and\nspatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with\ndense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and\nincorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate\noptions, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,\nTreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the\nmost advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%\naccuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87.

      "abstract": "CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples\ninvolving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,\nthe role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional\ngeneralization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when\na common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this\npaper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining\ndataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM\nperformance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from\nsingle-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual\ninformation (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words\nco-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using\nsynthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a\nstrong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot\naccuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap\nbetween images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even\naccuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the\nimage. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by\nediting them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of\nr=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs\nbuilt on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings\nhighlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional\ngeneralization in multimodal models without scaling the training data\ncombinatorially.

      "abstract": "Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language\nmodels (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of\nrecomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To\naddress this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers\nwith highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality.",

First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by\nstacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of\nhigh-level representations.

To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments\nfor the classification of images are suggested.

      "abstract": "Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) is a versatile hyperparameter\noptimization (HPO) method supported by popular HPO tools. Since these HPO tools\nhave been developed in line with the trend of deep learning (DL), the problem\nsetups often used in the DL domain have been discussed for TPE such as\nmulti-objective optimization and multi-fidelity optimization. However, the\npractical applications of HPO are not limited to DL, and black-box\ncombinatorial optimization is actively utilized in some domains, e.g.,\nchemistry and biology. As combinatorial optimization has been an untouched, yet\nvery important, topic in TPE, we propose an efficient combinatorial\noptimization algorithm for TPE. In this paper, we first generalize the\ncategorical kernel with the numerical kernel in TPE, enabling us to introduce a\ndistance structure to the categorical kernel. Then we discuss modifications for\nthe newly developed kernel to handle a large combinatorial search space. These\nmodifications reduce the time complexity of the kernel calculation with respect\nto the size of a combinatorial search space. In the experiments using synthetic\nproblems, we verified that our proposed method identifies better solutions with\nfewer evaluations than the original TPE. Our algorithm is available in Optuna,\nan open-source framework for HPO.",

This reduces parameters and preserves representation capability. (2)\nOn the learning side, we introduce Modality-Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss\n(MAC-Loss), which separates in-batch negatives into harder intra-modality and\neasier inter-modality groups based on the target modality, assigning different\ntemperature strategies to enhance learning efficiency.

However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle\nwith sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward\nGaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to\nincorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a\n3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse\nviews. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into\na globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an\nentropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal\ntransport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an\nalignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.\nFurthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the\n$\\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This\nenables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating\ncamera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets\ndemonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high\nfidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view\nsynthesis.

      "abstract": "We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object\ninteractions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with\nocclusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods\ntypically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading\nto degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in\nscenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework\nleverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially\nobscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual\nframes, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across\nvideo sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This\ntemplate-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on\npredefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in\ndynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on\nchallenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling\nocclusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.",

      "abstract": "Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very\nlarge context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in\ngeneration is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,\nwhich scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often\nthe dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput\nand increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV\ncache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked\n(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present\nCompactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses\napproximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that\nCompactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining\n1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal\ncomputational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated\ncompression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given\ncontext can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that\nCompactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV\nmemory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and\ngeneralizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and\nreal-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5\nand Llama 3.1 families.",

      "abstract": "As cyber-physical systems grow increasingly interconnected and spatially\ndistributed, ensuring their resilience against evolving cyberattacks has become\na critical priority. Spatio-Temporal Anomaly detection plays an important role\nin ensuring system security and operational integrity. However, current\ndata-driven approaches, largely driven by black-box deep learning, face\nchallenges in interpretability, adaptability to distribution shifts, and\nrobustness under evolving system dynamics. In this paper, we advocate for a\ncausal learning perspective to advance anomaly detection in spatially\ndistributed infrastructures that grounds detection in structural cause-effect\nrelationships. We identify and formalize three key directions: causal graph\nprofiling, multi-view fusion, and continual causal graph learning, each\noffering distinct advantages in uncovering dynamic cause-effect structures\nacross time and space. Drawing on real-world insights from systems such as\nwater treatment infrastructures, we illustrate how causal models provide early\nwarning signals and root cause attribution, addressing the limitations of\nblack-box detectors. Looking ahead, we outline the future research agenda\ncentered on multi-modality, generative AI-driven, and scalable adaptive causal\nframeworks. Our objective is to lay a new research trajectory toward scalable,\nadaptive, explainable, and spatially grounded anomaly detection systems. We\nhope to inspire a paradigm shift in cybersecurity research, promoting\ncausality-driven approaches to address evolving threats in interconnected\ninfrastructures.",

To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we\npropose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by\noptimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification\nand survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent\nstate-of-the-art MIL competitors.

For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of\nconvolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through\nconsecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and\nmemory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer\nlayers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For\ntransformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head\nattention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is\ncomputationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size\nreduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.\nNevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise\ntraining or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on\nhigher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the\nresolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by\nlearnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator\nwhich has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier\ntransform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the\nfrequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,\nfast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the\nBraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS\nshowed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model\nparameters.

      "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical\napplications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the\nmodels to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This\npaper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions\nbetween attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The\nframework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form\ngame, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while\nanticipating the attacker's optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI\nsolution, the \"Purple Agent,\" which integrates adversarial exploration and\ndefensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple\nAgent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes\nproactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled\nmethod for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for\nmitigating the risk of jailbreaking.",

However, a\nfiner-grained, segment-specific quantification has remained technically\ninfeasible. Conventional 3D models are forced to process downsampled volumes or\nisolated patches, sacrificing the global context required to resolve anatomical\nambiguity and render reliable landmark localization. To overcome this, we\nreformulate the 3D challenge as a \\textbf{Parallel Probabilistic Landmark\nLocalization} task along the 1D axial dimension. We propose the\n\\textbf{Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)}, a framework that processes\nfull-resolution CT volumes as sequences of 2D slices, learning to predict $N=6$\nindependent probability distributions that pinpoint key anatomical landmarks.\nOur DST framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness. Evaluated\non a 100-patient clinical cohort with rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, it\nachieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of \\textbf{0.1 slices}, with \\textbf{96\\%}\nof predictions falling within a $\\pm1$ slice tolerance. Furthermore, to\nvalidate its architectural power, the DST backbone establishes the best result\non the public Clean-CC-CCII classification benchmark under an end-to-end\nevaluation protocol. Our work delivers the first practical tool for automated\nsegment-specific ICAC analysis.

      "abstract": "A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to\nprocess the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order\nLogic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A\nfundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,\nwhich determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a\n(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all\npossible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic\nknowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground\nformulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other\nmethods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more\ncomputationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees\nof preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking\ninspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a\nparametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward\nChaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly\nemployed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off\nbetween expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental\nresults show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as\nimportant as the NeSy method itself.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model\nbased semantic communication framework is designed. Compared to standard neural\nnetwork (e.g.,convolutional neural network) based semantic encoders and\ndecoders that require joint training over a common dataset, our CLIP model\nbased method does not require any training procedures thus enabling a\ntransmitter to extract data meanings of the original data without neural\nnetwork model training, and the receiver to train a neural network for\nfollow-up task implementation without the communications with the transmitter.\nNext, we investigate the deployment of the CLIP model based semantic framework\nover a noisy wireless network. Since the semantic information generated by the\nCLIP model is susceptible to wireless noise and the spectrum used for semantic\ninformation transmission is limited, it is necessary to jointly optimize CLIP\nmodel architecture and spectrum resource block (RB) allocation to maximize\nsemantic communication performance while considering wireless noise, the delay\nand energy used for semantic communication. To achieve this goal, we use a\nproximal policy optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm\nto learn how wireless noise affect the semantic communication performance thus\nfinding optimal CLIP model and RB for each user. Simulation results show that\nour proposed method improves the convergence rate by up to 40%, and the\naccumulated reward by 4x compared to soft actor-critic.",

To explore more general spatial imagination capabilities, here we\npresent AirScape, the first world model designed for six-degree-of-freedom\naerial agents. AirScape predicts future observation sequences based on current\nvisual inputs and motion intentions. Specifically, we construct an dataset for\naerial world model training and testing, which consists of 11k video-intention\npairs. This dataset includes first-person-view videos capturing diverse drone\nactions across a wide range of scenarios, with over 1,000 hours spent\nannotating the corresponding motion intentions. Then we develop a two-phase\ntraining schedule to train a foundation model -- initially devoid of embodied\nspatial knowledge -- into a world model that is controllable by motion\nintentions and adheres to physical spatio-temporal constraints.",

We mostly repeated last year's design, to get another matching test set,\nbased on the larger, cleaner, less-biased v2 passage and document set, with\npassage ranking as primary and document ranking as a secondary task (using\nlabels inferred from passage). As we did last year, we sample from MS MARCO\nqueries that were completely held out, unused in corpus construction, unlike\nthe test queries in the first three years. This approach yields a more\ndifficult test with more headroom for improvement. Alongside the usual MS MARCO\n(human) queries from MS MARCO, this year we generated synthetic queries using a\nfine-tuned T5 model and using a GPT-4 prompt.\n  The new headline result this year is that runs using Large Language Model\n(LLM) prompting in some way outperformed runs that use the \"nnlm\" approach,\nwhich was the best approach in the previous four years. Since this is the last\nyear of the track, future iterations of prompt-based ranking can happen in\nother tracks. Human relevance assessments were applied to all query types, not\njust human MS MARCO queries. Evaluation using synthetic queries gave similar\nresults to human queries, with system ordering agreement of $\\tau=0.8487$.\nHowever, human effort was needed to select a subset of the synthetic queries\nthat were usable. We did not see clear evidence of bias, where runs using GPT-4\nwere favored when evaluated using synthetic GPT-4 queries, or where runs using\nT5 were favored when evaluated on synthetic T5 queries.",

We argue that the\nEntity-Component architectural pattern is useful here.

By design, the approach allows for a\nseparation between the underlying implementation details handled by an\nengineer, the creation of reusable components, and their composition and\nconfiguration managed by a designer who constructs entities from the\ncomponents. This separation of concerns is instrumental for achieving rapid\niteration, maintaining modularity, and ultimately to ensure scalability.

      "abstract": "Structured pruning aims to reduce the size and computational cost of deep\nneural networks by removing entire filters or channels. The traditional\nregularizers such as L1 or Group Lasso and its variants lead to\nmagnitude-biased pruning decisions, such that the filters with small magnitudes\nare likely to be pruned. Also, they often entail pruning results with almost\nzero margin around pruning decision boundary, such that tiny perturbation in a\nfilter magnitude can flip the pruning decision. In this paper, we identify the\nprecise algebraic condition under which pruning operations preserve model\nperformance, and use the condition to construct a novel regularizer defined in\nan extended parameter space via auxiliary catalyst variables. The proposed\nCatalyst regularization ensures fair pruning chance for each filters with\ntheoretically provable zero bias to their magnitude and robust pruning behavior\nachieved by wide-margin bifurcation of magnitudes between the preserved and the\npruned filters. The theoretical properties naturally lead to real-world\neffectiveness, as shown by empirical validations of Catalyst Pruning algorithm.\nPruning results on various datasets and models are superior to state-of-the-art\nfilter pruning methods, and at the same time confirm the predicted robust and\nfair pruning characteristics of Catalyst pruning.",

The magnitude importance and many correlated modern importance\ncriteria often limit the capacity of pruning decision, since the filters with\nlarger magnitudes are not likely to be pruned if the smaller one didn't, even\nif it is redundant. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning strategy to\nchallenge this dominating effect of magnitude and provide fair chance to each\nfilter to be pruned, by placing it on projective space. After that, we observe\nthe gradient descent movement whether the filters move toward the origin or\nnot, to measure how the filter is likely to be pruned. This measurement is used\nto construct PROscore, a novel importance score for IPPRO, a novel\nimportance-based structured pruning with magnitude-indifference. Our evaluation\nresults shows that the proposed importance criteria using the projective space\nachieves near-lossless pruning by reducing the performance drop in pruning,\nwith promising performance after the finetuning.

      "abstract": "Background: Mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety require improved\nmethods for early detection and personalized intervention. Traditional\npredictive models often rely on unimodal data or early fusion strategies that\nfail to capture the complex, multimodal nature of psychiatric data. Advanced\nintegration techniques, such as intermediate (latent space) fusion, may offer\nbetter accuracy and clinical utility. Methods: Using data from the BRIGHTEN\nclinical trial, we evaluated intermediate (latent space) fusion for predicting\ndaily depressive symptoms (PHQ-2 scores). We compared early fusion implemented\nwith a Random Forest (RF) model and intermediate fusion implemented via a\nCombined Model (CM) using autoencoders and a neural network. The dataset\nincluded behavioral (smartphone-based), demographic, and clinical features.\nExperiments were conducted across multiple temporal splits and data stream\ncombinations. Performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and\ncoefficient of determination (R2). Results: The CM outperformed both RF and\nLinear Regression (LR) baselines across all setups, achieving lower MSE (0.4985\nvs. 0.5305 with RF) and higher R2 (0.4695 vs. 0.4356). The RF model showed\nsigns of overfitting, with a large gap between training and test performance,\nwhile the CM maintained consistent generalization. Performance was best when\nintegrating all data modalities in the CM (in contradistinction to RF),\nunderscoring the value of latent space fusion for capturing non-linear\ninteractions in complex psychiatric datasets. Conclusion: Latent space fusion\noffers a robust alternative to traditional fusion methods for prediction with\nmultimodal mental health data. Future work should explore model\ninterpretability and individual-level prediction for clinical deployment.",

      "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as\nCatastrophic Forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after\nlearning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach\ninspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice\nand Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall\n(TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we\ntermed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the\nmodel's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test\nTFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading\nregularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR\nperforms significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split\nCIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's\n7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of\nthe probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally,\nwe analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that\nwhile TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay\nvolume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude\nthat TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of\nintegrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces SemRAG, an enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG) framework that efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge using\nsemantic chunking and knowledge graphs without extensive fine-tuning.\nIntegrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is\ncrucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing\nadaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit\nscalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking\nalgorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence\nembeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational\noverhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge\ngraphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval\naccuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and\nWikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance\nand correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph,\noutperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the\noptimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer\nsizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance,\nas integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better\ncontextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to\ncreate an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding\nresource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach\naligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI\napplications in domain-specific fields.",

      "authors": [

      "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive refutation of the so-called \"blockchain\ntrilemma,\" a widely cited but formally ungrounded claim asserting an inherent\ntrade-off between decentralisation, security, and scalability in blockchain\nprotocols. Through formal analysis, empirical evidence, and detailed critique\nof both methodology and terminology, we demonstrate that the trilemma rests on\nsemantic equivocation, misuse of distributed systems theory, and a failure to\ndefine operational metrics. Particular focus is placed on the conflation of\ntopological network analogies with protocol-level architecture, the\nmischaracterisation of Bitcoin's design--including the role of miners, SPV\nclients, and header-based verification--and the failure to ground claims in\ncomplexity-theoretic or adversarial models. By reconstructing Bitcoin as a\ndeterministic, stateless distribution protocol governed by evidentiary trust,\nwe show that scalability is not a trade-off but an engineering outcome. The\npaper concludes by identifying systemic issues in academic discourse and peer\nreview that have allowed such fallacies to persist, and offers formal criteria\nfor evaluating future claims in blockchain research.",
