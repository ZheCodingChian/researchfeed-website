Additionally, we propose a\nnovel masked next-token prediction task that incorporates masked prediction\ninto the causal LM framework. On AudioCaps, the innovation yields 41% and 33%\nrelative FAD improvements over AudioGen Base (285M) and AudioGen Large (1B)\nmodels, respectively, and is on par with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) diffusion\nmodels.

      "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming increasingly popular, with their\napplications now extending beyond just a mode of transportation to serving as\nmobile actuators of a traffic flow to control flow dynamics. This contrasts\nwith traditional fixed-location actuators, such as traffic signals, and is\nreferred to as Lagrangian traffic control. However, designing effective\nLagrangian traffic control policies for AVs that generalize across traffic\nscenarios introduces a major challenge. Real-world traffic environments are\nhighly diverse, and developing policies that perform robustly across such\ndiverse traffic scenarios is challenging. It is further compounded by the joint\ncomplexity of the multi-agent nature of traffic systems, mixed motives among\nparticipants, and conflicting optimization objectives subject to strict\nphysical and external constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce\nMulti-Residual Mixture of Expert Learning (MRMEL), a novel framework for\nLagrangian traffic control that augments a given suboptimal nominal policy with\na learned residual while explicitly accounting for the structure of the traffic\nscenario space. In particular, taking inspiration from residual reinforcement\nlearning, MRMEL augments a suboptimal nominal AV control policy by learning a\nresidual correction, but at the same time dynamically selects the most suitable\nnominal policy from a pool of nominal policies conditioned on the traffic\nscenarios and modeled as a mixture of experts. We validate MRMEL using a case\nstudy in cooperative eco-driving at signalized intersections in Atlanta, Dallas\nFort Worth, and Salt Lake City, with real-world data-driven traffic scenarios.\nThe results show that MRMEL consistently yields superior performance-achieving\nan additional 4%-9% reduction in aggregate vehicle emissions relative to the\nstrongest baseline in each setting.",

      "abstract": "Relational databases underpin critical infrastructure across a wide range of\ndomains, yet the design of generalizable pre-training strategies for learning\nfrom relational databases remains an open challenge due to task heterogeneity.\nSpecifically, there exist infinitely many possible downstream tasks, as tasks\nare defined based on relational schema graphs, temporal dependencies, and\nSQL-defined label logics. An effective pre-training framework is desired to\ntake these factors into account in order to obtain task-aware representations.\nBy incorporating knowledge of the underlying distribution that drives label\ngeneration, downstream tasks can benefit from relevant side-channel\ninformation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task Vector Estimation (TVE), a\nnovel pre-training framework that constructs predictive supervisory signals via\nset-based aggregation over schema traversal graphs, explicitly modeling\nnext-window relational dynamics. We formalize our approach through an\ninformation-theoretic lens, demonstrating that task-informed representations\nretain more relevant signals than those obtained without task priors. Extensive\nexperiments on the RelBench benchmark show that TVE consistently outperforms\ntraditional pre-training baselines. Our findings advocate for pre-training\nobjectives that encode task heterogeneity and temporal structure as design\nprinciples for predictive modeling on relational databases.",

However, WSD relies on explicit decay\nphases to track progress, while weight averaging addresses this limitation at\nthe cost of additional memory. In search of a more principled and scalable\nalternative, we revisit the Schedule-Free (SF) method [Defazio et al., 2024],\nwhich has shown strong empirical performance across diverse settings. We show\nthat SF-AdamW effectively navigates the \"river\" structure of the loss landscape\nwithout decay phases or auxiliary averaging, making it particularly suitable\nfor continuously scaling training workloads. To understand this behavior, we\nconduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of SF dynamics, revealing that it\nimplicitly performs weight averaging without memory overhead. Guided by this\nanalysis, we propose a refined variant of SF that improves robustness to\nmomentum and performs better under large batch sizes, addressing key\nlimitations of the original method. Together, these results establish SF as a\npractical, scalable, and theoretically grounded approach for language model\ntraining.",

      "abstract": "Reasoning-capable language models achieve state-of-the-art performance in\ndiverse complex tasks by generating long, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\ntraces. While recent works show that base models can acquire such reasoning\ntraces via reinforcement learning or distillation from stronger models like\nDeepSeek-R1, previous works demonstrate that even short CoT prompting without\nfine-tuning is able to improve reasoning. We ask whether long CoT can be\ninduced in a base model using only prompting or minimal tuning. Using just 20\nlong CoT examples from the reasoning model \\texttt{QwQ-32B-Preview}, we lightly\nfine-tune the base model \\texttt{Qwen2.5-32B}. The resulting model outperforms\nthe much larger \\texttt{Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct}, showing that a handful of\nhigh-quality examples can unlock strong reasoning capabilities. We further\nexplore using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators, enhanced\nwith prompt engineering, multi-pass editing, and structural guidance. However,\nneither matches the performance of reasoning model traces, suggesting that\ncertain latent qualities of expert CoT are difficult to replicate. We analyze\nkey properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty, diversity, and\nanswer length, that influence reasoning distillation. While challenges remain,\nwe are optimistic that carefully curated human-written CoT, even in small\nquantities, can activate reasoning behaviors in base models. We release our\nhuman-authored dataset across refinement stages and invite further\ninvestigation into what makes small-scale reasoning supervision so effective.",

Due to challenges related\nto distance, altitude, and face orientation, high-resolution imagery and\nsophisticated neural networks enable accurate face recognition in dynamic\nenvironments. However, privacy concerns arise from the extensive surveillance\ncapabilities of UAVs. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework that\nintegrates HE with advanced neural networks to secure facial data throughout\nthe inference phase. This method ensures that facial data remains secure with\nminimal impact on detection accuracy. Specifically, the proposed system\nleverages the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme to perform computations directly\non encrypted data, optimizing computational efficiency and security.\nFurthermore, we develop an effective data encoding method specifically designed\nto preprocess the raw facial data into CKKS form in a\nSingle-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) manner. Building on this, we design a\nsecure inference algorithm to compute on ciphertext without needing decryption.\nThis approach not only protects data privacy during the processing of facial\ndata but also enhances the efficiency of UAV-based face detection systems.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method effectively balances privacy\nprotection and detection performance, making it a viable solution for UAV-based\nsecure face detection. Significantly, our approach (while maintaining data\nconfidentially with HE encryption) can still achieve an accuracy of less than\n1% compared to the benchmark without using encryption.",

These advanced methodologies offer\nhigh-fidelity solutions for avatar driving and rendering, leading academia to\nfocus on the next major challenge: audio-visual dyadic interactive virtual\nhuman. To facilitate research in this emerging area, we present SpeakerVid-5M\ndataset, the first large-scale, high-quality dataset designed for audio-visual\ndyadic interactive virtual human generation. Totaling over 8,743 hours,\nSpeakerVid-5M contains more than 5.2 million video clips of human portraits. It\ncovers diverse scales and interaction types, including monadic talking,\nlistening, and dyadic conversations. Crucially, the dataset is structured along\ntwo key dimensions: interaction type and data quality. First, it is categorized\ninto four types (dialogue branch, single branch, listening branch and\nmulti-turn branch) based on the interaction scenario. Second, it is stratified\ninto a large-scale pre-training subset and a curated, high-quality subset for\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This dual structure accommodates a wide array of\n2D virtual human tasks. In addition, we provide an autoregressive (AR)-based\nvideo chat baseline trained on this data, accompanied by a dedicated set of\nmetrics and test data to serve as a benchmark VidChatBench for future work.\nBoth the dataset and the corresponding data processing code will be publicly\nreleased.

Under this view,\none can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream\ntasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as\n(i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream\ntasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the\nvariance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the\ndefined Task Priors?

Here, we present a physics-guided deep learning framework for\ntemperature data reconstruction that integrates these two data sources.

We evaluated this framework using data from two satellites, GOES-16\n(2 km, hourly) and Landsat (100 m, every 16 days), and demonstrated effective\ntemperature reconstruction with hold-out and in situ data across four datasets.\nThis physics-guided deep learning framework opens new possibilities for\ngenerating high-resolution temperature data across spatial and temporal scales,\nunder all weather conditions and globally.",

Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as\npath patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their\nnotable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a\nfunction induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from\nstandard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the\nstructure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it\nto a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1\nfunction is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which\nemits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function\ninduction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic\ntasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8\naddition.

      "abstract": "Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals\nwith high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as\nautonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid\ndevelopment of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning\ncapabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual\ninformation for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video\nreasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content\nwhile reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning\nparadigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive\nand cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the\nVideo-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for\nkey-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore\nthe potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances\nperformance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively\nactivates more neuron values in MLLMs.",

      "abstract": "We consider the problem of covering multiple submodular constraints. Given a\nfinite ground set $N$, a cost function $c: N \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_+$, $r$\nmonotone submodular functions $f_1,f_2,\\ldots,f_r$ over $N$ and requirements\n$b_1,b_2,\\ldots,b_r$ the goal is to find a minimum cost subset $S \\subseteq N$\nsuch that $f_i(S) \\ge b_i$ for $1 \\le i \\le r$. When $r=1$ this is the\nwell-known Submodular Set Cover problem. Previous work\n\\cite{chekuri2022covering} considered the setting when $r$ is large and\ndeveloped bi-criteria approximation algorithms, and approximation algorithms\nfor the important special case when each $f_i$ is a weighted coverage function.\nThese are fairly general models and capture several concrete and interesting\nproblems as special cases. The approximation ratios for these problem are at\nleast $\\Omega(\\log r)$ which is unavoidable when $r$ is part of the input. In\nthis paper, motivated by some recent applications, we consider the problem when\n$r$ is a \\emph{fixed constant} and obtain two main results. For covering\nmultiple submodular constraints we obtain a randomized bi-criteria\napproximation algorithm that for any given integer $\\alpha \\ge 1$ outputs a set\n$S$ such that $f_i(S) \\ge$ $(1-1/e^\\alpha -\\epsilon)b_i$ for each $i \\in [r]$\nand $\\mathbb{E}[c(S)] \\le (1+\\epsilon)\\alpha \\cdot \\sf{OPT}$. Second, when the\n$f_i$ are weighted coverage functions from a deletion-closed set system we\nobtain a $(1+\\epsilon)$ $(\\frac{e}{e-1})$ $(1+\\beta)$-approximation where\n$\\beta$ is the approximation ratio for the underlying set cover instances via\nthe natural LP. These results show that one can obtain nearly as good an\napproximation for any fixed $r$ as what one would achieve for $r=1$. We mention\nsome applications that follow easily from these general results and anticipate\nmore in the future.",

In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework\nthat simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time\nand introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art\nopen-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support\nto 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based\nvideo object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal\ncorrespondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel\nMask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and\nmitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating\nmemory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding\nfusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of\nthe proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3%\nacceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was\nlimited to parsing fixed classes.",

A critical challenge\nis verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference\nanswers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced.\nRule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based\nverifiers. However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM\njudges can be inconsistent. Existing research primarily focuses on building\nbetter verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers'\nperformance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable\ndevelopment of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). To address\nthis, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for\nsystematically evaluating verifiers. We construct 4,000 expert-level questions\ncovering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Each question is\nequipped with reference answers and diverse responses. The reliability of the\nevaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a\nmultidisciplinary expert team. We design a four-dimensional experimental\nframework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized\nverifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs.\ncomplete responses, and short vs. long outputs. Our evaluation uncovers\nfundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve\nleading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show\nstronger inclusivity but unstable precision.

      "abstract": "Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSI) from RGB images is a cost-effective\nsolution for various vision-based applications. However, most existing\nlearning-based hyperspectral reconstruction methods directly learn the\nRGB-to-HSI mapping using complex attention mechanisms, neglecting the inherent\nchallenge of transitioning from low-dimensional to high-dimensional\ninformation. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage approach, MCGA,\nwhich first learns spectral patterns before estimating the mapping. In the\nfirst stage, a multi-scale VQ-VAE learns representations from heterogeneous HSI\ndatasets, extracting a Mixture of Codebooks (MoC). In the second stage, the\nRGB-to-HSI mapping is refined by querying features from the MoC to replace\nlatent HSI representations, incorporating prior knowledge rather than forcing a\ndirect high-dimensional transformation. To further enhance reconstruction\nquality, we introduce Grayscale-Aware Attention and Quantized Self-Attention,\nwhich adaptively adjust feature map intensities to meet hyperspectral\nreconstruction requirements. This physically motivated attention mechanism\nensures lightweight and efficient HSI recovery. Moreover, we propose an\nentropy-based Test-Time Adaptation strategy to improve robustness in real-world\nscenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, MCGA, achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance. The code and models will be released at\nhttps://github.com/Fibonaccirabbit/MCGA",

      "abstract": "Time series forecasting is a fundamental task with broad applications, yet\nconventional methods often treat data as discrete sequences, overlooking their\norigin as noisy samples of continuous processes. Crucially, discrete noisy\nobservations cannot uniquely determine a continuous function; instead, they\ncorrespond to a family of plausible functions. Mathematically, time series can\nbe viewed as noisy observations of a continuous function family governed by a\nshared probability measure. Thus, the forecasting task can be framed as\nlearning the transition from the historical function family to the future\nfunction family. This reframing introduces two key challenges: (1) How can we\nleverage discrete historical and future observations to learn the relationships\nbetween their underlying continuous functions? (2) How can we model the\ntransition path in function space from the historical function family to the\nfuture function family? To address these challenges, we propose NeuTSFlow, a\nnovel framework that leverages Neural Operators to facilitate flow matching for\nlearning path of measure between historical and future function families. By\nparameterizing the velocity field of the flow in infinite-dimensional function\nspaces, NeuTSFlow moves beyond traditional methods that focus on dependencies\nat discrete points, directly modeling function-level features instead.\nExperiments on diverse forecasting tasks demonstrate NeuTSFlow's superior\naccuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of the function-family\nperspective.",

Recent\ngraph-based scRNA-seq clustering methods, particularly graph neural networks\n(GNNs), have significantly improved in tackling the challenges of\nhigh-dimension, high-sparsity, and frequent dropout events that lead to\nambiguous cell population boundaries. However, their reliance on hard graph\nconstructions derived from thresholded similarity matrices presents\nchallenges:(i) The simplification of intercellular relationships into binary\nedges (0 or 1) by applying thresholds, which restricts the capture of\ncontinuous similarity features among cells and leads to significant information\nloss.(ii) The presence of significant inter-cluster connections within hard\ngraphs, which can confuse GNN methods that rely heavily on graph structures,\npotentially causing erroneous message propagation and biased clustering\noutcomes. To tackle these challenges, we introduce scSGC, a Soft Graph\nClustering for single-cell RNA sequencing data, which aims to more accurately\ncharacterize continuous similarities among cells through non-binary edge\nweights, thereby mitigating the limitations of rigid data structures. The scSGC\nframework comprises three core components: (i) a zero-inflated negative\nbinomial (ZINB)-based feature autoencoder; (ii) a dual-channel cut-informed\nsoft graph embedding module; and (iii) an optimal transport-based clustering\noptimization module. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate that\nscSGC outperforms 13 state-of-the-art clustering models in clustering accuracy,\ncell type annotation, and computational efficiency. These results highlight its\nsubstantial potential to advance scRNA-seq data analysis and deepen our\nunderstanding of cellular heterogeneity.",

However,\nrecent studies on rotation-equivariant aerial object detection remain scarce.\nMost detectors rely on data augmentation to enable models to learn\napproximately rotation-equivariant features. A few detectors have constructed\nrotation-equivariant networks, but due to the breaking of strict rotation\nequivariance by typical downsampling processes, these networks only achieve\napproximately rotation-equivariant backbones. Whether strict rotation\nequivariance is necessary for aerial image object detection remains an open\nquestion. In this paper, we implement a strictly rotation-equivariant backbone\nand neck network with a more advanced network structure and compare it with\napproximately rotation-equivariant networks to quantitatively measure the\nimpact of rotation equivariance on the performance of aerial image detectors.\nAdditionally, leveraging the inherently grouped nature of rotation-equivariant\nfeatures, we propose a multi-branch head network that reduces the parameter\ncount while improving detection accuracy. Based on the aforementioned\nimprovements, this study proposes the Multi-branch head rotation-equivariant\nsingle-stage Detector (MessDet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nthe challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and DIOR-R with an\nexceptionally low parameter count.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the effectiveness of U-Net architectures integrated\nwith various convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones for automated lung\ncancer detection and segmentation in chest CT images, addressing the critical\nneed for accurate diagnostic tools in clinical settings. A balanced dataset of\n832 chest CT images (416 cancerous and 416 non-cancerous) was preprocessed\nusing Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and resized to\n128x128 pixels. U-Net models were developed with three CNN backbones: ResNet50,\nVGG16, and Xception, to segment lung regions. After segmentation, CNN-based\nclassifiers and hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional\nmachine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and\nGradient Boosting) were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Metrics\nincluded accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Dice coefficient, and ROC-AUC.\nU-Net with ResNet50 achieved the best performance for cancerous lungs (Dice:\n0.9495, Accuracy: 0.9735), while U-Net with VGG16 performed best for\nnon-cancerous segmentation (Dice: 0.9532, Accuracy: 0.9513). For\nclassification, the CNN model using U-Net with Xception achieved 99.1 percent\naccuracy, 99.74 percent recall, and 99.42 percent F1-score. The hybrid\nCNN-SVM-Xception model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy and 97.88 percent\nF1-score. Compared to prior methods, our framework consistently outperformed\nexisting models. In conclusion, combining U-Net with advanced CNN backbones\nprovides a powerful method for both segmentation and classification of lung\ncancer in CT scans, supporting early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.",

Large Population\nModels (LPMs) offer an approach to understand these complex systems by\nsimulating entire populations with realistic behaviors and interactions at\nunprecedented scale. LPMs extend traditional modeling approaches through three\nkey innovations: computational methods that efficiently simulate millions of\nagents simultaneously, mathematical frameworks that learn from diverse\nreal-world data streams, and privacy-preserving communication protocols that\nbridge virtual and physical environments. This allows researchers to observe\nhow agent behavior aggregates into system-level outcomes and test interventions\nbefore real-world implementation. While current AI advances primarily focus on\ncreating \"digital humans\" with sophisticated individual capabilities, LPMs\ndevelop \"digital societies\" where the richness of interactions reveals emergent\nphenomena. By bridging individual agent behavior and population-scale dynamics,\nLPMs offer a complementary path in AI research illuminating collective\nintelligence and providing testing grounds for policies and social innovations\nbefore real-world deployment. We discuss the technical foundations and some\nopen problems here. LPMs are implemented by the AgentTorch framework\n(github.com/AgentTorch/AgentTorch)",

In this paper, we propose Instructional Graphic Designer (IGD) to\nswiftly generate multimodal layers with editable flexibility with only natural\nlanguage instructions. IGD adopts a new paradigm that leverages parametric\nrendering and image asset generation. First, we develop a design platform and\nestablish a standardized format for multi-scenario design files, thus laying\nthe foundation for scaling up data. Second, IGD utilizes the multimodal\nunderstanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLM to accomplish attribute\nprediction, sequencing and layout of layers. It also employs a diffusion model\nto generate image content for assets. By enabling end-to-end training, IGD\narchitecturally supports scalability and extensibility in complex graphic\ndesign tasks.

Additionally, these methods typically require separate training for\ndifferent objects, leading to computational inefficiencies. To address these\nissues, we propose Crucial-Diff, a domain-agnostic framework designed to\nsynthesize crucial samples. Our method integrates two key modules. The Scene\nAgnostic Feature Extractor (SAFE) utilizes a unified feature extractor to\ncapture target information. The Weakness Aware Sample Miner (WASM) generates\nhard-to-detect samples using feedback from the detection results of downstream\nmodel, which is then fused with the output of SAFE module. Together, our\nCrucial-Diff framework generates diverse, high-quality training data, achieving\na pixel-level AP of 83.63% and an F1-MAX of 78.12% on MVTec. On polyp dataset,\nCrucial-Diff reaches an mIoU of 81.64% and an mDice of 87.69%. Code will be\nreleased after acceptance.",

This paper presents a novel methodology for\ninterpreting how an LLM encodes and utilizes domain-specific knowledge, using a\nBoiling Water Reactor system as a case study. We adapted a general-purpose LLM\n(Gemma-3-1b-it) to the nuclear domain using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning\ntechnique known as Low-Rank Adaptation. By comparing the neuron activation\npatterns of the base model to those of the fine-tuned model, we identified a\nsparse set of neurons whose behavior was significantly altered during the\nadaptation process. To probe the causal role of these specialized neurons, we\nemployed a neuron silencing technique. Our results demonstrate that while\nsilencing most of these specialized neurons individually did not produce a\nstatistically significant effect, deactivating the entire group collectively\nled to a statistically significant degradation in task performance. Qualitative\nanalysis further revealed that silencing these neurons impaired the model's\nability to generate detailed, contextually accurate technical information. This\npaper provides a concrete methodology for enhancing the transparency of an\nopaque black-box model, allowing domain expertise to be traced to verifiable\nneural circuits. This offers a pathway towards achieving nuclear-grade\nartificial intelligence (AI) assurance, addressing the verification and\nvalidation challenges mandated by nuclear regulatory frameworks (e.g., 10 CFR\n50 Appendix B), which have limited AI deployment in safety-critical nuclear\noperations.",

To overcome this\nchallenge, we push beyond the electron dose limits of conventional electron\nmicroscopy by adapting principles from multi-image super-resolution (MISR) that\nhave been widely used in remote sensing. Our method fuses multiple\nlow-resolution, sub-pixel-shifted views and enhances the reconstruction with a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) that integrates features from synthetic,\nmulti-angle observations. We developed a dual-path, attention-guided network\nfor 4D-STEM that achieves atomic-scale super-resolution from ultra-low-dose\ndata. This provides robust atomic-scale visualization across amorphous,\nsemi-crystalline, and crystalline beam-sensitive specimens. Systematic\nevaluations on representative materials demonstrate comparable spatial\nresolution to conventional ptychography under ultra-low-dose conditions. Our\nwork expands the capabilities of 4D-STEM, offering a new and generalizable\nmethod for the structural analysis of radiation-vulnerable materials.",

Compared to its\npredecessor, Octopi-1.5 introduces the ability to process tactile signals from\nmultiple object parts and employs a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\nmodule to improve performance on tasks and potentially learn new objects\non-the-fly. The system can be experienced live through a new handheld\ntactile-enabled interface, the TMI, equipped with GelSight and TAC-02 tactile\nsensors. This convenient and accessible setup allows users to interact with\nOctopi-1.5 without requiring a robot. During the demonstration, we will\nshowcase Octopi-1.5 solving tactile inference tasks by leveraging tactile\ninputs and commonsense knowledge. For example, in a Guessing Game, Octopi-1.5\nwill identify objects being grasped and respond to follow-up queries about how\nto handle it (e.g., recommending careful handling for soft fruits). We also\nplan to demonstrate Octopi-1.5's RAG capabilities by teaching it new items.\nWith live interactions, this demonstration aims to highlight both the progress\nand limitations of VTLMs such as Octopi-1.5 and to foster further interest in\nthis exciting field.

The HAPPO\nalgorithm proposes a feasible solution by introducing a sequential update\nscheme, which requires independent learning with No Parameter-sharing (NoPS).\nHowever, heterogeneous MARL generally requires Partial Parameter-sharing\n(ParPS) based on agent grouping to achieve high cooperative performance. Our\nexperiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update\nscheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to\nachieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and\nParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG)\nalgorithm. First, we replace the sequentially computed $Q_{\\psi}^s(s,a_{1:i})$\nwith the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function $\\phi_{\\psi}^*(s,a_{1:i})$ derived\nfrom Q-functions. This maintains MAAD's monotonic improvement while eliminating\nthe conflict through optimal joint action sequences instead of sequential\npolicy ratio calculations. Second, we introduce the Generalized Q Critic (GQC)\nas the critic function, employing pessimistic uncertainty-constrained loss to\noptimize different Q-value estimations. This provides the required Q-values for\nOMQ computation and stable baselines for actor updates. Finally, we implement a\nCentralized Critic Grouped Actor (CCGA) architecture that simultaneously\nachieves ParPS in local policy networks and accurate global Q-function\ncomputation. Experimental results in SMAC and MAMuJoCo environments demonstrate\nthat OMDPG outperforms various state-of-the-art MARL baselines.",

LoRA is also communication-efficient for federated\nLLMs when multiple users collaboratively fine-tune a global LLM model without\nsharing their proprietary raw data. However, even the transmission of local\nadapters between a server and clients risks serious privacy leakage. Applying\ndifferential privacy (DP) to federated LoRA encounters a dilemma: adding noise\nto both adapters amplifies synthetic noise on the model, while fixing one\nadapter impairs the learnability of fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose\nFedASK (Differentially Private Federated Low Rank Adaptation with Double\nSketching) , a novel federated LoRA framework to enable effective updating of\nboth low-rank adapters with robust differential privacy. Inspired by randomized\nSVD, our key idea is a two-stage sketching pipeline. This pipeline first\naggregates carefully sketched, privacy-preserving local updates, and then\nreconstructs the global matrices on the server to facilitate effective updating\nof both adapters. We theoretically prove FedASK's differential privacy\nguarantee and its exact aggregation property. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that FedASK consistently outperforms baseline methods across a\nvariety of privacy settings and data distributions.",

While fear is believed to have\nevolved under pressure from predators, experimentally reproducing the evolution\nis challenging. To investigate the relationship between environmental\nconditions, the evolution of fear, and the evolution of other rewards, such as\nfood reward and social reward, we developed a distributed evolutionary\nsimulation. In our simulation, prey and predator agents co-evolve their innate\nreward functions, including a possibly fear-like term for observing predators,\nand learn behaviors via reinforcement learning. Surprisingly, our simulation\nrevealed that social reward for observing the same species is more important\nfor prey to survive, and fear-like negative reward for observing predators\nevolves only after acquiring social reward. We also found that the predator\nwith increased hunting ability (larger mouth) amplified fear emergence, but\nalso that fear evolution is more stable with non-evolving predators that are\nbad at chasing prey. Additionally, unlike for predators, we found that positive\nrewards evolve in opposition to fear for stationary threats, as areas with\nabundant leftover food develop around them. These findings suggest that fear\nand social reward have had a complex interplay with each other through\nevolution, along with the nature of predators and threats.",

In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian-based Adversarial Attack\n(3DGAA), a novel adversarial object generation framework that leverages the\nfull 14-dimensional parameterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to jointly\noptimize geometry and appearance in physically realizable ways. Unlike prior\nworks that rely on patches or texture optimization, 3DGAA jointly perturbs both\ngeometric attributes (shape, scale, rotation) and appearance attributes (color,\nopacity) to produce physically realistic and transferable adversarial objects.\nWe further introduce a physical filtering module that filters outliers to\npreserve geometric fidelity, and a physical augmentation module that simulates\ncomplex physical scenarios to enhance attack generalization under real-world\nconditions. We evaluate 3DGAA on both virtual benchmarks and physical-world\nsetups using miniature vehicle models. Experimental results show that 3DGAA\nachieves to reduce the detection mAP from 87.21\\% to 7.38\\%, significantly\noutperforming existing 3D physical attacks. Moreover, our method maintains high\ntransferability across different physical conditions, demonstrating a new\nstate-of-the-art in physically realizable adversarial attacks.",

To address\nthis, we propose the Edge Iterative MRI Lesion Localization System\n(EdgeIMLocSys), which integrates Continuous Learning from Human Feedback to\nadaptively fine-tune segmentation models based on clinician feedback, thereby\nenhancing robustness to scanner-specific imaging characteristics. Central to\nthis system is the Graph-based Multi-Modal Interaction Lightweight Network for\nBrain Tumor Segmentation (GMLN-BTS), which employs a Modality-Aware Adaptive\nEncoder (M2AE) to extract multi-scale semantic features efficiently, and a\nGraph-based Multi-Modal Collaborative Interaction Module (G2MCIM) to model\ncomplementary cross-modal relationships via graph structures. Additionally, we\nintroduce a novel Voxel Refinement UpSampling Module (VRUM) that\nsynergistically combines linear interpolation and multi-scale transposed\nconvolutions to suppress artifacts while preserving high-frequency details,\nimproving segmentation boundary accuracy. Our proposed GMLN-BTS model achieves\na Dice score of 85.1% on the BraTS2017 dataset with only 4.58 million\nparameters, representing a 98% reduction compared to mainstream 3D Transformer\nmodels, and significantly outperforms existing lightweight approaches.

Key metrics\nfrom DTI and NODDI were extracted and projected onto 2D planes to enable\ntransfer learning with ImageNet-pretrained models.

We assessed the framework on diagnostic group prediction\n(cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia)\nand amyloid status classification.\n  Results: The framework achieved competitive classification results within the\nscope of multi-shell dMRI-based features, with the best balanced accuracy of\n95.2% for distinguishing cognitively normal individuals from those with\nAlzheimer's disease dementia using NODDI metrics. For amyloid detection, it\nreached 77.2% balanced accuracy in distinguishing amyloid-positive mild\ncognitive impairment/Alzheimer's disease dementia subjects from\namyloid-negative cognitively normal subjects, and 67.9% for identifying\namyloid-positive individuals among cognitively normal subjects.

This approach exponentially reduces the\nmotion error in a pixel-wise and frame-wise loopable manner. Despite its\nefficacy, P-BSC suffers from high computational overhead and error accumulation\ndue to its reliance on multi-frame phase calculations and weighted summations.\nInspired by P-BSC, we propose an image-sequential binomial self-compensation\n(I-BSC) to weight sum the homogeneous fringe images instead of successive phase\nframes, which generalizes the BSC concept from phase sequences to image\nsequences. I-BSC computes the arctangent function only once, resolving both\nlimitations in P-BSC. Extensive analysis, simulations, and experiments show\nthat 1) the proposed BSC outperforms existing methods in reducing motion error\nwhile achieving a quasi-single-shot frame rate, i.e., depth map frame rate\nequals to the camera's acquisition rate, enabling 3D reconstruction with high\npixel-depth-temporal resolution; 2) compared to P-BSC, our I-BSC reduces the\ncomputational complexity by one polynomial order, thereby accelerating the\ncomputational frame rate by several to dozen times, while also reaching faster\nmotion error convergence.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether\nvision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways\nthat reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the\nbouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like \"bouba\"\nwith round shapes and \"kiki\" with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found\nin prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive\nre-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer\n(ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two\ncomplementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based\nevaluation that uses probabilities as model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as\na novel way to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our\nfindings show that these models do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki\neffect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance\nacross both models lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison\nwith prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall\nmarkedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of\nhuman cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the\nextent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting\nlimitations in their internal representations and alignment with human\nintuitions.",

However, given the complexity of training such\nconnectors on large scale web-based datasets coupled with the ever-increasing\nnumber of available pretrained uni-modal models, the task of uni-modal models\nselection and subsequent connector module training becomes computationally\ndemanding. To address this under-studied critical problem, we propose\nHypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel all-in-one solution for optimal\nuni-modal model selection and connector training by leveraging hypernetworks.\nSpecifically, our framework utilizes the parameter prediction capability of a\nhypernetwork to obtain jointly trained connector modules for $N \\times M$\ncombinations of uni-modal models. In our experiments, Hyma reduces the cost of\nsearching for the best performing uni-modal model pair by $10\\times$, while\nmatching the ranking and trained connector performance obtained via grid search\nacross a suite of diverse multi-modal benchmarks.",

To this end, we propose a selective\noptimization framework that adaptively chooses between backpropagation on\nlow-resolution images (BP-low) and zeroth-order optimization on high-resolution\nimages (ZO-high), guided by the characteristics of the diffusion process. As\nobserved in our experiments, BP-low efficiently adapts the model to\ntarget-specific features, but suffers from structural distortions due to\nresolution mismatch. Conversely, ZO-high refines high-resolution details with\nminimal memory overhead but faces slow convergence when applied without prior\nadaptation. By complementing both methods, our framework leverages BP-low for\neffective personalization while using ZO-high to maintain structural\nconsistency, achieving memory-efficient and high-quality fine-tuning. To\nmaximize the efficacy of both BP-low and ZO-high, we introduce a timestep-aware\nprobabilistic function that dynamically selects the appropriate optimization\nstrategy based on diffusion timesteps. This function mitigates the overfitting\nfrom BP-low at high timesteps, where structural information is critical, while\nensuring ZO-high is applied more effectively as training progresses.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive\nperformance while significantly reducing memory consumption, enabling scalable,\nhigh-quality on-device personalization without increasing inference latency.",

      "abstract": "Point cloud place recognition (PCPR) plays a crucial role in photogrammetry\nand robotics applications such as autonomous driving, intelligent\ntransportation, and augmented reality. In real-world large-scale deployments of\na positioning system, PCPR models must continuously acquire, update, and\naccumulate knowledge to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments, i.e., the\nability known as continual learning (CL). However, existing PCPR models often\nsuffer from catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant performance\ndegradation in previously learned scenes when adapting to new environments or\nsensor types. This results in poor model scalability, increased maintenance\ncosts, and system deployment difficulties, undermining the practicality of\nPCPR. To address these issues, we propose LifelongPR, a novel continual\nlearning framework for PCPR, which effectively extracts and fuses knowledge\nfrom sequential point cloud data. First, to alleviate the knowledge loss, we\npropose a replay sample selection method that dynamically allocates sample\nsizes according to each dataset's information quantity and selects spatially\ndiverse samples for maximal representativeness. Second, to handle domain\nshifts, we design a prompt learning-based CL framework with a lightweight\nprompt module and a two-stage training strategy, enabling domain-specific\nfeature adaptation while minimizing forgetting. Comprehensive experiments on\nlarge-scale public and self-collected datasets are conducted to validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethods, our method achieves 6.50% improvement in mIR@1, 7.96% improvement in\nmR@1, and an 8.95% reduction in F.

      "abstract": "Poultry farming is a vital component of the global food supply chain, yet it\nremains highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as coccidiosis,\nsalmonellosis, and Newcastle disease. This study proposes a lightweight machine\nlearning-based approach to detect these diseases by analyzing poultry fecal\nimages. We utilize multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) and\nexplore a wide range of color, texture, and shape-based descriptors, including\ncolor histograms, local binary patterns (LBP), wavelet transforms, and edge\ndetectors. Through a systematic ablation study and dimensionality reduction\nusing PCA and XGBoost feature selection, we identify a compact global feature\nset that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. An artificial neural\nnetwork (ANN) classifier trained on these features achieved 95.85% accuracy\nwhile requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab.\nCompared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed\nmodel offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This\nwork demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to\ndeep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource\nagricultural settings.",

To address this, we propose PRISM, a\nnovel document-to-document retrieval method that introduces multiple,\nfine-grained representations for both the query and candidate papers. In\nparticular, each query paper is decomposed into multiple aspect-specific views\nand individually embedded, which are then matched against candidate papers\nsimilarity segmented to consider their multifaceted dimensions. Moreover, we\npresent SciFullBench, a novel benchmark in which the complete and segmented\ncontext of full papers for both queries and candidates is available.

The interface presents both\ntechnical and layperson-friendly explanations in addition to a side-by-side\ncomparison of the uploaded and reconstructed images. A user study with 15\nparticipants shows that simplified explanations significantly improve clarity\nand reduce cognitive load, with most users expressing increased confidence in\nidentifying deepfakes.

Second, we develop an online trust\nevaluation method to dynamically estimate HVs' trust levels during\nlane-changing interactions, guiding AVs to select context-appropriate\ncooperative maneuvers. Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered\nby minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the\npredictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and\ncontext-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment\nconducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach.\nResults show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different\nHVs' trust levels and driving styles. Moreover, incorporating a trust mechanism\nsignificantly improves lane-changing efficiency, maintains safety, and\ncontributes to transparent and adaptive AV-HV interactions.",

They ascribe a\ndialectical strength to (components of) arguments sanctioning their degree of\nacceptability. Several gradual semantics have been studied for abstract,\nbipolar and quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs), as well as,\nto a lesser extent, for some forms of structured argumentation. However, this\nhas not been the case for assumption-based argumentation (ABA), despite it\nbeing a popular form of structured argumentation with several applications\nwhere gradual semantics could be useful. In this paper, we fill this gap and\npropose a family of novel gradual semantics for equipping assumptions, which\nare the core components in ABA frameworks, with dialectical strengths. To do\nso, we use bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks as an abstraction of\n(potentially non-flat) ABA frameworks and generalise state-of-the-art modular\ngradual semantics for QBAFs. We show that our gradual ABA semantics satisfy\nsuitable adaptations of desirable properties of gradual QBAF semantics, such as\nbalance and monotonicity. We also explore an argument-based approach that\nleverages established QBAF modular semantics directly, and use it as baseline.\nFinally, we conduct experiments with synthetic ABA frameworks to compare our\ngradual ABA semantics with its argument-based counterpart and assess\nconvergence.",

In this\nwork, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However,\ndirectly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at\nthe beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these\nfixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe\nthat, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical\nrepresentations. These representations either integrate significant information\nfrom preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through\nlayer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final\noutput. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential\nto greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we\npropose Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT), a novel method that\nidentifies and optimizes these critical representations through information\nflow analysis. CRFT operates within a supervised learning framework,\ndynamically optimizing critical representations in a low-rank linear subspace\nwhile freezing the base model. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method\nare validated across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning,\nusing LLaMA and Mistral model families. Furthermore, our method also adapts\neffectively to few-shot settings, boosting one-shot accuracy by 16.4%. Our work\nhighlights the untapped potential of representation-level optimization for CoT\nreasoning, offering a lightweight yet powerful alternative to traditional PEFT\nmethods.",

      "abstract": "Identifying bias in LLMs is ongoing. Because they are still in development,\nwhat is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies\nfor debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for\ndebiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they\nincorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge\ninto awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of\ninformation contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and\ncontradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if\nprompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making\nliterature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show\npromise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is \"could you be wrong?\"\nFollowing an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional\ninformation, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases,\ncontradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their\ninitial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and\nusers interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a\nset of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including\nimplicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. \"Could you be\nwrong\" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent\nmetacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing\nbut incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive\nprompt. In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for\nprompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based\nimprovements to human decision making.",

While\ntraditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate\ncardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored\nin this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA)\npoint tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography.\nAlthough these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general\nvideos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain\nlimited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode\nultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different\nviews is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we\nrefine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations\nto reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through\nimpartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging\nmulti-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced\nspatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning\nwith our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their\nbaselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker\nboosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error\nby 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking\nmodels fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking\naccuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to\nechocardiography.

In the Navigation phase, a Synergy Map\nblends controller velocity with an occupancy grid to rank interaction areas.\nUpon arrival at a goal, an autonomous multi-view scan builds a local 3D cloud.\nThe Manipulation phase combines U2Net saliency, FastSAM instance saliency, and\nthree geometric grasp-feasibility tests, with an end-effector kinematics-aware\nupdate rule that evolves object probabilities in real-time. GUIDER can\nrecognize areas and objects of intent without predefined goals. We evaluated\nGUIDER on 25 trials (five participants x five task variants) in Isaac Sim, and\ncompared it with two baselines, one for navigation and one for manipulation.\nAcross the 25 trials, GUIDER achieved a median stability of 93-100% during\nnavigation, compared with 60-100% for the BOIR baseline, with an improvement of\n39.5% in a redirection scenario (T5).

In geometry-constrained trials (manipulation), GUIDER\nrecognized the object intent three times earlier than Trajectron (median\nremaining time to confident prediction 23.6 s vs 7.8 s). These results validate\nour dual-phase framework and show improvements in intent inference in both\nphases of mobile manipulation tasks.",

In\nUAV-Assisted Wildfire Monitoring (UAWM) systems, joint optimization of sensor\ntransmission scheduling and velocity is critical for minimizing Age of\nInformation (AoI) from stale sensor data. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has\nbeen used for such optimization; however, its limitations such as low sampling\nefficiency, simulation-to-reality gaps, and complex training render it\nunsuitable for time-critical applications like wildfire monitoring. This paper\nintroduces a new online Flight Resource Allocation scheme based on LLM-Enabled\nIn-Context Learning (FRSICL) to jointly optimize the UAV's flight control and\ndata collection schedule along the trajectory in real time, thereby\nasymptotically minimizing the average AoI across ground sensors. In contrast to\nDRL, FRSICL generates data collection schedules and controls velocity using\nnatural language task descriptions and feedback from the environment, enabling\ndynamic decision-making without extensive retraining. Simulation results\nconfirm the effectiveness of the proposed FRSICL compared to Proximal Policy\nOptimization (PPO) and Nearest-Neighbor baselines.",

      "abstract": "AI has driven significant progress in the nutrition field, especially through\nmultimedia-based automatic dietary assessment. However, existing automatic\ndietary assessment systems often overlook critical non-visual factors, such as\nrecipe-specific ingredient substitutions that can significantly alter\nnutritional content, and rarely account for individual dietary needs, including\nallergies, restrictions, cultural practices, and personal preferences. In\nSwitzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains\nfragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant\nnutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context. To bridge this divide, we\nintroduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our\nbest knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with\nnutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national\nnutrition guidelines under one graph. We establish a LLM-powered enrichment\npipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first\nbenchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge\naugmentation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the\ngraph with relevant nutritional information. Our SwissFKG goes beyond recipe\nrecommendations by offering ingredient-level information such as allergen and\ndietary restriction information, and guidance aligned with nutritional\nguidelines. Moreover, we implement a Graph-RAG application to showcase how the\nSwissFKG's rich natural-language data structure can help LLM answer\nuser-specific nutrition queries, and we evaluate LLM-embedding pairings by\ncomparing user-query responses against predefined expected answers. As such,\nour work lays the foundation for the next generation of dietary assessment\ntools that blend visual, contextual, and cultural dimensions of eating.",

Among these,\nDecision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of\noffline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned\npolicy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al.\n(2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based\noffline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative\nQ-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in\nsparse-reward and low-quality data settings.\n  In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks\n(Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered\nBehavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to\nDT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing\ntrajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on\nthe filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also\nrequires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results\ntherefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments.\nFrom prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward\nenvironments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?",

In this\npaper, we show that a small, fine-tuned language model can achieve high-quality\npostcondition generation with much lower computational costs. We construct a\nspecialized dataset of prompts, reasoning logs, and postconditions, then\nsupervise the fine-tuning of a $7$B-parameter code model. Our approach tackles\nreal-world repository dependencies and preserves pre-state information,\nallowing for expressive and accurate specifications. We evaluate the model on a\nbenchmark of real-world Java bugs (Defects4J) and compare against both\nproprietary giants (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source large models. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that our compact model matches or outperforms significantly\nlarger counterparts in syntax correctness, semantic correctness, and\nbug-distinguishing capability.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a unified\ntext-based person retrieval pipeline considering domain adaptation at both\nimage and region levels. In particular, it contains two primary components,\ni.e., Domain-aware Diffusion (DaD) for image-level adaptation and\nMulti-granularity Relation Alignment (MRA) for region-level adaptation. As the\nname implies, Domain-aware Diffusion is to migrate the distribution of images\nfrom the pretraining dataset domain to the target real-world dataset domain,\ne.g., CUHK-PEDES. Subsequently, MRA performs a meticulous region-level\nalignment by establishing correspondences between visual regions and their\ndescriptive sentences, thereby addressing disparities at a finer granularity.\nExtensive experiments show that our dual-level adaptation method has achieved\nstate-of-the-art results on the CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid datasets,\noutperforming existing methodologies.

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation.\nHowever, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and\nreasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that\nMLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained\nimage encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images\ndirectly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution\ndiscrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring\nconsistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then\nPredict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework\ndesigned to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key\nintuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,\ntheir predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization\ncues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and\nthen predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively\npreserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by\nhigh-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K\nMLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared\nto baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness.

      "abstract": "Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may\nperform worse than unimodal learning. Existing approaches attribute this issue\nto imbalanced learning across modalities and tend to address it through\ngradient balancing. However, this paper argues that balanced learning is not\nthe optimal setting for multimodal learning. With bias-variance analysis, we\nprove that imbalanced dependency on each modality obeying the inverse ratio of\ntheir variances contributes to optimal performance. To this end, we propose the\nAsymmetric Representation Learning(ARL) strategy to assist multimodal learning\nvia imbalanced optimization. ARL introduces auxiliary regularizers for each\nmodality encoder to calculate their prediction variance. ARL then calculates\ncoefficients via the unimodal variance to re-weight the optimization of each\nmodality, forcing the modality dependence ratio to be inversely proportional to\nthe modality variance ratio. Moreover, to minimize the generalization error,\nARL further introduces the prediction bias of each modality and jointly\noptimizes them with multimodal loss. Notably, all auxiliary regularizers share\nparameters with the multimodal model and rely only on the modality\nrepresentation. Thus the proposed ARL strategy introduces no extra parameters\nand is independent of the structures and fusion methods of the multimodal\nmodel. Finally, extensive experiments on various datasets validate the\neffectiveness and versatility of ARL.

In this paper, we drew on multiple fields such as visual analytics,\ncognition, and dashboard design to propose a method for categorising and\ncomparing XAI studies under three dimensions: what, why, and who. We identified\nthe main problems as: inadequate descriptions of tasks, context-free studies,\nand insufficient testing with target users. We propose that studies should\nspecifically report on their users' domain, AI, and data analysis expertise to\nillustrate the generalisability of their findings. We also propose study\nguidelines for designing and reporting XAI tasks to improve the XAI community's\nability to parse the rapidly growing field. We hope that our contribution can\nhelp researchers and designers better identify which studies are most relevant\nto their work, what gaps exist in the research, and how to handle contradictory\nresults regarding XAI design.",

Emotional\nexpression and micro-expression research probe into understanding human\npsychological responses to emotional stimuli, thereby revealing substantial\nhidden yet authentic emotions that can be useful in the event of diagnosis and\ninterviews. While increased attention had been provided to micro-expression\nanalysis, the studies were done under Ekman's assumption of emotion\nuniversality, where emotional expressions are identical across cultures and\nsocial contexts. Our computational study uncovers some of the influences of\nethnic background in expression analysis, leading to an argument that the\nemotional universality hypothesis is an overgeneralization from the perspective\nof manual psychological analysis. In this research, we propose to investigate\nthe level of influence of ethnicity in a simulated micro-expression scenario.\nWe construct a cross-cultural micro-expression database and algorithmically\nannotate the ethnic labels to facilitate the investigation. With the ethnically\nannotated dataset, we perform a prima facie study to compare mono-ethnicity and\nstereo-ethnicity in a controlled environment, which uncovers a certain\ninfluence of ethnic bias via an experimental way. Building on this finding, we\npropose a framework that integrates ethnic context into the emotional feature\nlearning process, yielding an ethnically aware framework that recognises\nethnicity differences in micro-expression recognition. For improved\nunderstanding, qualitative analyses have been done to solidify the preliminary\ninvestigation into this new realm of research.

      "abstract": "Multimodal learning often encounters the under-optimized problem and may have\nworse performance than unimodal learning. Existing methods attribute this\nproblem to the imbalanced learning between modalities and rebalance them\nthrough gradient modulation. However, they fail to explain why the dominant\nmodality in multimodal models also underperforms that in unimodal learning. In\nthis work, we reveal the optimization conflict between the modality encoder and\nmodality fusion module in multimodal models. Specifically, we prove that the\ncross-modal fusion in multimodal models decreases the gradient passed back to\neach modality encoder compared with unimodal models. Consequently, the\nperformance of each modality in the multimodal model is inferior to that in the\nunimodal model. To this end, we propose a disentangled gradient learning (DGL)\nframework to decouple the optimization of the modality encoder and modality\nfusion module in the multimodal model. DGL truncates the gradient\nback-propagated from the multimodal loss to the modality encoder and replaces\nit with the gradient from unimodal loss. Besides, DGL removes the gradient\nback-propagated from the unimodal loss to the modality fusion module. This\nhelps eliminate the gradient interference between the modality encoder and\nmodality fusion module while ensuring their respective optimization processes.\nFinally, extensive experiments on multiple types of modalities, tasks, and\nframeworks with dense cross-modal interaction demonstrate the effectiveness and\nversatility of the proposed DGL.

Existing subject-driven image generation methods often\nrequire either (1) inference-time fine-tuning with few images for each new\nsubject or (2) large-scale dataset training for generalization. Both approaches\nare computationally expensive and impractical for real-time applications. To\naddress these limitations, we present Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA, a novel\npart-level controllable model for personalized human image generation. By\ntraining only LoRA layers, our method removes the computational burden at\ninference while ensuring high-fidelity synthesis of unseen subjects. Our key\nidea is to condition the generation on the subject's wardrobe and leverage\nspatial references to reduce information loss, thereby improving fidelity and\nconsistency. Additionally, we introduce a selective subject region loss, which\nencourages the model to disregard some of reference images during training. Our\nloss ensures that generated images better align with text prompts while\nmaintaining subject integrity. Notably, our Wardrobe Polyptych LoRA requires no\nadditional parameters at the inference stage and performs generation using a\nsingle model trained on a few training samples. We construct a new dataset and\nbenchmark tailored for personalized human image generation. Extensive\nexperiments show that our approach significantly outperforms existing\ntechniques in fidelity and consistency, enabling realistic and\nidentity-preserving full-body synthesis.",

To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel\nalternative called Straighten Viscous Rectified Flow via Noise Optimization\n(VRFNO), which is a joint training framework integrating an encoder and a\nneural velocity field. VRFNO introduces two key innovations: (1) a historical\nvelocity term that enhances trajectory distinction, enabling the model to more\naccurately predict the velocity of the current trajectory, and (2) the noise\noptimization through reparameterization to form optimized couplings with real\nimages which are then utilized for training, effectively mitigating errors\ncaused by Reflow's limitations.

      "abstract": "We present Spatial Lifting (SL), a novel methodology for dense prediction\ntasks. SL operates by lifting standard inputs, such as 2D images, into a\nhigher-dimensional space and subsequently processing them using networks\ndesigned for that higher dimension, such as a 3D U-Net. Counterintuitively,\nthis dimensionality lifting allows us to achieve good performance on benchmark\ntasks compared to conventional approaches, while reducing inference costs and\nsignificantly lowering the number of model parameters. The SL framework\nproduces intrinsically structured outputs along the lifted dimension. This\nemergent structure facilitates dense supervision during training and enables\nrobust, near-zero-additional-cost prediction quality assessment at test time.\nWe validate our approach across 19 benchmark datasets (13 for semantic\nsegmentation and 6 for depth estimation), demonstrating competitive dense\nprediction performance while reducing the model parameter count by over 98% (in\nthe U-Net case) and lowering inference costs. Spatial Lifting introduces a new\nvision modeling paradigm that offers a promising path toward more efficient,\naccurate, and reliable deep networks for dense prediction tasks in vision.",

However, some challenging OOD\nsamples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space,\ncan still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like\ndiffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a\npotential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel\napproach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging\nOOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level\ndiscrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative\nin-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced,\nboundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise\nadjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score,\neffectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully\nsynthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label\nfeatures derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between\nnear-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark,\nwith minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly\nsurpasses existing methods, improving AUROC by 2.80% and reducing FPR95 by\n11.13%. Codes are available in https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.",

      "abstract": "Recent research has investigated the shape and texture biases of deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) in image classification which influence their generalization\ncapabilities and robustness. It has been shown that, in comparison to regular\nDNN training, training with stylized images reduces texture biases in image\nclassification and improves robustness with respect to image corruptions. In an\neffort to advance this line of research, we examine whether style transfer can\nlikewise deliver these two effects in semantic segmentation. To this end, we\nperform style transfer with style varying across artificial image areas. Those\nrandom areas are formed by a chosen number of Voronoi cells. The resulting\nstyle-transferred data is then used to train semantic segmentation DNNs with\nthe objective of reducing their dependence on texture cues while enhancing\ntheir reliance on shape-based features. In our experiments, it turns out that\nin semantic segmentation, style transfer augmentation reduces texture bias and\nstrongly increases robustness with respect to common image corruptions as well\nas adversarial attacks. These observations hold for convolutional neural\nnetworks and transformer architectures on the Cityscapes dataset as well as on\nPASCAL Context, showing the generality of the proposed method.",

In the object-centric scenarios with sparse inputs, the\naccuracy of pose estimation can be significantly influenced by background\ntextures that occupy major portions of the images across different viewpoints.\nIn light of this, we introduce the Kaleidoscopic Background Attack (KBA), which\nuses identical segments to form discs with multi-fold radial symmetry. These\ndiscs maintain high similarity across different viewpoints, enabling effective\nattacks on pose estimation models even with natural texture segments.\nAdditionally, a projected orientation consistency loss is proposed to optimize\nthe kaleidoscopic segments, leading to significant enhancement in the attack\neffectiveness. Experimental results show that optimized adversarial\nkaleidoscopic backgrounds can effectively attack various camera pose estimation\nmodels.",

However, most transformer\narchitectures embed images into uniform, grid-based vision tokens, neglecting\nthe underlying semantic meanings of image regions, resulting in suboptimal\nfeature representations. To address this issue, we propose Fuzzy Token\nClustering Transformer (FTCFormer), which incorporates a novel clustering-based\ndownsampling module to dynamically generate vision tokens based on the semantic\nmeanings instead of spatial positions. It allocates fewer tokens to less\ninformative regions and more to represent semantically important regions,\nregardless of their spatial adjacency or shape irregularity. To further enhance\nfeature extraction and representation, we propose a Density Peak\nClustering-Fuzzy K-Nearest Neighbor (DPC-FKNN) mechanism for clustering center\ndetermination, a Spatial Connectivity Score (SCS) for token assignment, and a\nchannel-wise merging (Cmerge) strategy for token merging. Extensive experiments\non 32 datasets across diverse domains validate the effectiveness of FTCFormer\non image classification, showing consistent improvements over the TCFormer\nbaseline, achieving gains of improving 1.43% on five fine-grained datasets,\n1.09% on six natural image datasets, 0.97% on three medical datasets and 0.55%\non four remote sensing datasets.

Traditional methods struggle to preserve fine-grained,\nidentity-specific features when degradation is severe, often producing\naverage-looking faces that lack individual characteristics. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce IP-FVR, a novel method that leverages a high-quality\nreference face image as a visual prompt to provide identity conditioning during\nthe denoising process. IP-FVR incorporates semantically rich identity\ninformation from the reference image using decoupled cross-attention\nmechanisms, ensuring detailed and identity consistent results. For intra-clip\nidentity drift (within 24 frames), we introduce an identity-preserving feedback\nlearning method that combines cosine similarity-based reward signals with\nsuffix-weighted temporal aggregation. This approach effectively minimizes drift\nwithin sequences of frames. For inter-clip identity drift, we develop an\nexponential blending strategy that aligns identities across clips by\niteratively blending frames from previous clips during the denoising process.\nThis method ensures consistent identity representation across different clips.\nAdditionally, we enhance the restoration process with a multi-stream negative\nprompt, guiding the model's attention to relevant facial attributes and\nminimizing the generation of low-quality or incorrect features. Extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IP-FVR\noutperforms existing methods in both quality and identity preservation,\nshowcasing its substantial potential for practical applications in face video\nrestoration.",

Conversely, the structure of resamplers\nshows promise in tackling these challenges, but an effective solution remains\nunexplored. Drawing inspiration from resampler structures, we introduce DisCo,\na novel visual encapsulation method designed to yield semantically distinct and\ntemporally coherent visual tokens for video MLLMs. DisCo integrates two key\ncomponents: (1) A Visual Concept Discriminator (VCD) module, assigning unique\nsemantics for visual tokens by associating them in pair with discriminative\nconcepts in the video. (2) A Temporal Focus Calibrator (TFC) module, ensuring\nconsistent temporal focus of visual tokens to video elements across every video\nframe. Through extensive experiments on multiple video MLLM frameworks, we\ndemonstrate that DisCo remarkably outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods\nacross a variety of video understanding benchmarks, while also achieving higher\ntoken efficiency thanks to the reduction of semantic indistinctness.

However, previous\nworks have ignored the misalignment when introducing the foundation models into\nfeature matching. The misalignment arises from the discrepancy between the\nfoundation models focusing on single-image understanding and the cross-image\nunderstanding requirement of feature matching. Specifically, 1) the embeddings\nderived from commonly used foundation models exhibit discrepancies with the\noptimal embeddings required for feature matching; 2) lacking an effective\nmechanism to leverage the single-image understanding ability into cross-image\nunderstanding. A significant consequence of the misalignment is they struggle\nwhen addressing multi-instance feature matching problems. To address this, we\nintroduce a simple but effective framework, called IMD (Image feature Matching\nwith a pre-trained Diffusion model) with two parts: 1) Unlike the dominant\nsolutions employing contrastive-learning based foundation models that emphasize\nglobal semantics, we integrate the generative-based diffusion models to\neffectively capture instance-level details. 2) We leverage the prompt mechanism\nin generative model as a natural tunnel, propose a novel cross-image\ninteraction prompting module to facilitate bidirectional information\ninteraction between image pairs. To more accurately measure the misalignment,\nwe propose a new benchmark called IMIM, which focuses on multi-instance\nscenarios. Our proposed IMD establishes a new state-of-the-art in commonly\nevaluated benchmarks, and the superior improvement 12% in IMIM indicates our\nmethod efficiently mitigates the misalignment.",

      "abstract": "Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior\nwork has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional\narchitectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space\nmodels (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose\nunique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter\ndynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on\nGrowth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the\nimpact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM\nfor three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models\n(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance\nresilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on\nclean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)\nrobustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to\n8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our\napproach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial\ndefense. Codes are available at https://github.com/BouriMohammed/GBM",

      "abstract": "Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning (Hetero-FL) has attracted growing\nattention for its ability to aggregate knowledge from heterogeneous models\nwhile keeping private data locally. To better aggregate knowledge from clients,\nensemble distillation, as a widely used and effective technique, is often\nemployed after global aggregation to enhance the performance of the global\nmodel. However, simply combining Hetero-FL and ensemble distillation does not\nalways yield promising results and can make the training process unstable. The\nreason is that existing methods primarily focus on logit distillation, which,\nwhile being model-agnostic with softmax predictions, fails to compensate for\nthe knowledge bias arising from heterogeneous models. To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose a stable and efficient Feature Distillation for model-heterogeneous\nFederated learning, dubbed FedFD, that can incorporate aligned feature\ninformation via orthogonal projection to integrate knowledge from heterogeneous\nmodels better. Specifically, a new feature-based ensemble federated knowledge\ndistillation paradigm is proposed. The global model on the server needs to\nmaintain a projection layer for each client-side model architecture to align\nthe features separately. Orthogonal techniques are employed to re-parameterize\nthe projection layer to mitigate knowledge bias from heterogeneous models and\nthus maximize the distilled knowledge. Extensive experiments show that FedFD\nachieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

Existing works generally employ the deterministic textual\nfeature adapter to refine each category textual representation. However, due to\ninherent factors such as different attributes and contexts, there exists\nsignificant diversity in textual descriptions for each category. Such\ndescription diversity offers rich discriminative semantic knowledge that can\nbenefit downstream visual learning tasks. Obviously, traditional deterministic\nadapter model cannot adequately capture this varied semantic information. Also,\nit is desirable to exploit the inter-class relationships in VLM adapter. To\naddress these issues, we propose to exploit random graph model into VLM adapter\nand develop a novel Vertex Random Graph Adapter (VRGAdapter). VRGAdapter first\nmodels the inherent diverse descriptions of each category and inter-class\nrelationships of different categories simultaneously by leveraging a Vertex\nRandom Knowledge Graph (VRKG) model. Then, it employs probabilistic message\npropagation on VRKG to learn context-aware distribution representation for each\nclass node. Finally, it adopts a reparameterized sampling function to achieve\ntextual adapter learning. Note that, VRGAdapter provides a more general adapter\nsolution that encompasses traditional graph-based adapter as a special case. In\naddition, to enable more robust performance for downstream tasks, we also\nintroduce a new Uncertainty-guided Multi-branch Fusion (UMF) scheme that\ndynamically integrates multiple pre-trained models for ensemble prediction.\nExtensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach.",

Existing ZSD\nworks are mainly coarse-grained object detection, where the classes are\nvisually quite different, thus are relatively easy to distinguish. However, in\nreal life we often have to face fine-grained object detection scenarios, where\nthe classes are too similar to be easily distinguished. For example, detecting\ndifferent kinds of birds, fishes, and flowers.\n  In this paper, we propose and solve a new problem called Fine-Grained\nZero-Shot Object Detection (FG-ZSD for short), which aims to detect objects of\ndifferent classes with minute differences in details under the ZSD paradigm. We\ndevelop an effective method called MSHC for the FG-ZSD task, which is based on\nan improved two-stage detector and employs a multi-level semantics-aware\nembedding alignment loss, ensuring tight coupling between the visual and\nsemantic spaces. Considering that existing ZSD datasets are not suitable for\nthe new FG-ZSD task, we build the first FG-ZSD benchmark dataset FGZSD-Birds,\nwhich contains 148,820 images falling into 36 orders, 140 families, 579 genera\nand 1432 species. Extensive experiments on FGZSD-Birds show that our method\noutperforms existing ZSD models.",

In imaging contexts, TDA\ntypically models data as filtered cubical complexes from which we can extract\ndiscriminative features using persistence homology. Meanwhile, convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be biased towards texture based local\nfeatures. To address this limitation, we propose a TDA feature engineering\npipeline and a simple method to integrate topological features with deep\nlearning models on remote sensing classification. Our method improves the\nperformance of a ResNet18 model on the EuroSAT dataset by 1.44% achieving\n99.33% accuracy, which surpasses all previously reported single-model\naccuracies, including those with larger architectures, such as ResNet50 (2x\nlarger) and XL Vision Transformers (197x larger). We additionally show that our\nmethod's accuracy is 1.82% higher than our ResNet18 baseline on the RESISC45\ndataset. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TDA features in\nsatellite scene classification with deep learning. This demonstrates that TDA\nfeatures can be integrated with deep learning models, even on datasets without\nexplicit topological structures, thereby increasing the applicability of TDA. A\nclean implementation of our method will be made publicly available upon\npublication.",

However,\nmost text-to-image retrieval systems are limited to RGB data, failing to\nexploit the unique physical information captured by other sensors, such as the\nall-weather structural sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or the\nspectral signatures in optical multispectral data. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce CrisisLandMark, a new large-scale corpus of over 647,000 Sentinel-1\nSAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral images paired with structured textual\nannotations for land cover, land use, and crisis events harmonized from\nauthoritative land cover systems (CORINE and Dynamic World) and crisis-specific\nsources. We then present CLOSP (Contrastive Language Optical SAR Pretraining),\na novel framework that uses text as a bridge to align unpaired optical and SAR\nimages into a unified embedding space. Our experiments show that CLOSP achieves\na new state-of-the-art, improving retrieval nDGC by 54% over existing models.\nAdditionally, we find that the unified training strategy overcomes the inherent\ndifficulty of interpreting SAR imagery by transferring rich semantic knowledge\nfrom the optical domain with indirect interaction. Furthermore, GeoCLOSP, which\nintegrates geographic coordinates into our framework, creates a powerful\ntrade-off between generality and specificity: while the CLOSP excels at general\nsemantic tasks, the GeoCLOSP becomes a specialized expert for retrieving\nlocation-dependent crisis events and rare geographic features.

We evaluate the energy\nconsumption of DeepRX, considering factors including FLOPs/Watt and\nFLOPs/clock, and find consistency between estimated and actual energy usage,\ninfluenced by memory access patterns. The research extends to comparing energy\ndynamics during training and inference phases. A key contribution is the\napplication of knowledge distillation (KD) to train a compact DeepRX student\nmodel that emulates the performance of the teacher model but with reduced\nenergy consumption. We experiment with different student model sizes, optimal\nteacher sizes, and KD hyperparameters. Performance is measured by comparing the\nBit Error Rate (BER) performance versus Signal-to-Interference & Noise Ratio\n(SINR) values of the distilled model and a model trained from scratch. The\ndistilled models demonstrate a lower error floor across SINR levels,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of KD in achieving energy-efficient AI\nsolutions.",

To address these limitations, we\npropose Text-Visual Semantic Constrained AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment\n(SC-AGIQA), a unified framework that leverages text-visual semantic constraints\nto significantly enhance the comprehensive evaluation of both text-image\nconsistency and perceptual distortion in AI-generated images. Our approach\nintegrates key capabilities from multiple models and tackles the aforementioned\nchallenges by introducing two core modules: the Text-assisted Semantic\nAlignment Module (TSAM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) to bridge the semantic gap by generating an image description and\ncomparing it against the original prompt for a refined consistency check, and\nthe Frequency-domain Fine-Grained Degradation Perception Module (FFDPM), which\ndraws inspiration from Human Visual System (HVS) properties by employing\nfrequency domain analysis combined with perceptual sensitivity weighting to\nbetter quantify subtle visual distortions and enhance the capture of\nfine-grained visual quality details in images.

To address this, we propose\n4D-Animal, a novel framework that reconstructs animatable 3D animals from\nvideos without requiring sparse keypoint annotations. Our approach introduces a\ndense feature network that maps 2D representations to SMAL parameters,\nenhancing both the efficiency and stability of the fitting process.\nFurthermore, we develop a hierarchical alignment strategy that integrates\nsilhouette, part-level, pixel-level, and temporal cues from pre-trained 2D\nvisual models to produce accurate and temporally coherent reconstructions\nacross frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4D-Animal outperforms\nboth model-based and model-free baselines. Moreover, the high-quality 3D assets\ngenerated by our method can benefit other 3D tasks, underscoring its potential\nfor large-scale applications.

With this\ncorpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification\nquestions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We\nfind that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing\nclarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans\nand LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential\nambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce\nmore clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task\nuncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is\npredicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with\ndifferent reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase\nquestion frequency and relevancy.",

To overcome this\nissue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive\nconvolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive\nPansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive\nkernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of\nspatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the\nPansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an\nattention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail\nenhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly\navailable datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared\nto existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and\nqualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the\neffectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.",

Although existing methods\nintroduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality\nreference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems,\nmainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this\npaper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from\nhigh-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image\nrestoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and\nreconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference\nselection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a\nRefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating\nmasks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the\ntrivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion\nparadigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.\nFinally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further\nensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle\nconsistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive\nexperiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance,\nshowing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer\nquality.

In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely\non cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes\nand weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly\ndepend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to\ngeo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel\nretrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month)\nand geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate\nencoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a\nshared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time,\ninstead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives,\nwe propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by\nmodeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present\nnew benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous\ntime prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an\ninput during inference. Additionally, our approach achieves competitive results\non standard geo-localization tasks, and the unified embedding space facilitates\ncompositional and text-based image retrieval.",

      "abstract": "The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in\nolder adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can\ngreatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely\nintervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective\nand reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this\nwork, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary\nsystems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system\n(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human\nfall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall\nscenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor\nlocalization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a\nrobot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an\nedge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen\npeople. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different\naccuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to\n99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3%\naccuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the\naccuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework\ncreates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall\naccuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults,\nbut it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning models have been proposed for automatic polyp detection and\nprecise segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy procedures. Although these\nstate-of-the-art models achieve high performance, they often require a large\nnumber of parameters. Their complexity can make them prone to overfitting,\nparticularly when trained on biased datasets, and can result in poor\ngeneralization across diverse datasets. Knowledge distillation and\nself-distillation are proposed as promising strategies to mitigate the\nlimitations of large, over-parameterized models. These approaches, however, are\nresource-intensive, often requiring multiple models and significant memory\nduring training. We propose a confidence-based self-distillation approach that\noutperforms state-of-the-art models by utilizing only previous iteration data\nstorage during training, without requiring extra computation or memory usage\nduring testing. Our approach calculates the loss between the previous and\ncurrent iterations within a batch using a dynamic confidence coefficient. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on the task of polyp segmentation. Our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models and generalizes well across datasets collected from\nmultiple clinical centers. The code will be released to the public once the\npaper is accepted.",

      "abstract": "Retinal anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in screening ocular and\nsystemic diseases. Despite its significance, progress in the field has been\nhindered by the absence of a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark,\nwhich is essential for the fair evaluation and advancement of methodologies.\nDue to this limitation, previous anomaly detection work related to retinal\nimages has been constrained by (1) a limited and overly simplistic set of\nanomaly types, (2) test sets that are nearly saturated, and (3) a lack of\ngeneralization evaluation, resulting in less convincing experimental setups.\nFurthermore, existing benchmarks in medical anomaly detection predominantly\nfocus on one-class supervised approaches (training only with negative samples),\noverlooking the vast amounts of labeled abnormal data and unlabeled data that\nare commonly available in clinical practice. To bridge these gaps, we introduce\na benchmark for retinal anomaly detection, which is comprehensive and\nsystematic in terms of data and algorithm. Through categorizing and\nbenchmarking previous methods, we find that a fully supervised approach\nleveraging disentangled representations of abnormalities (DRA) achieves the\nbest performance but suffers from significant drops in performance when\nencountering certain unseen anomalies. Inspired by the memory bank mechanisms\nin one-class supervised learning, we propose NFM-DRA, which integrates DRA with\na Normal Feature Memory to mitigate the performance degradation, establishing a\nnew SOTA. The benchmark is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/DopamineLcy/BenchReAD.",

Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning\nimproves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains\nfrom PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying\nintrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for\ngeneralization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera\nintrinsics.

We integrate very high spatial resolution (1.5 m) Earth observation\ndata and deep transfer learning to derive crop field delineations in complex\nagricultural systems at the national scale, while maintaining minimum reference\ndata requirements and enhancing transferability. We provide the first\nnational-level dataset of 21 million individual fields for Mozambique (covering\n~800,000 km2) for 2023. Our maps separate active cropland from non-agricultural\nland use with an overall accuracy of 93% and balanced omission and commission\nerrors. Field-level spatial agreement reached median intersection over union\n(IoU) scores of 0.81, advancing the state-of-the-art in large-area field\ndelineation in complex smallholder systems. The active cropland maps capture\nfragmented rural regions with low cropland shares not yet identified in global\nland cover or cropland maps. These regions are mostly located in agricultural\nfrontier regions which host 7-9% of the Mozambican population. Field size in\nMozambique is very low overall, with half of the fields being smaller than 0.16\nha, and 83% smaller than 0.5 ha. Mean field size at aggregate spatial\nresolution (0.05{\\deg}) is 0.32 ha, but it varies strongly across gradients of\naccessibility, population density, and net forest cover change. This variation\nreflects a diverse set of actors, ranging from semi-subsistence smallholder\nfarms to medium-scale commercial farming, and large-scale farming operations.\nOur results highlight that field size is a key indicator relating to\nsocio-economic and environmental outcomes of agriculture (e.g., food\nproduction, livelihoods, deforestation, biodiversity), as well as their\ntrade-offs.",

Implemented\nin the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes\nconfirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model\nfine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and\nrevisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased\nlatency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated\ndialogue history.

However, this poses significant challenges to\nlatency, because the MLLM inference takes up most of the response time, leaving\nvery little time for video streaming. Due to network uncertainty and\ninstability, transmission latency becomes a critical bottleneck preventing AI\nfrom being like a real person. To address this, we propose Artic, an\nAI-oriented Real-time Communication framework, exploring the network\nrequirement shift from \"humans watching video\" to \"AI understanding video\". To\nreduce bitrate dramatically while maintaining MLLM accuracy, we propose\nContext-Aware Video Streaming that recognizes the importance of each video\nregion for chat and allocates bitrate almost exclusively to chat-important\nregions. To avoid packet retransmission, we propose Loss-Resilient Adaptive\nFrame Rate that leverages previous frames to substitute for lost/delayed frames\nwhile avoiding bitrate waste. To evaluate the impact of video streaming quality\non MLLM accuracy, we build the first benchmark, named Degraded Video\nUnderstanding Benchmark (DeViBench). Finally, we discuss some open questions\nand ongoing solutions for AI Video Chat.",

Here, we introduce TS-GEN, a\nconditional flow-matching generative model that maps samples from a simple\nGaussian prior directly to transition-state saddle-point geometries in a\nsingle, deterministic pass. By embedding both reactant and product\nconformations as conditioning information, TS-GEN learns to transport latent\nnoise to true TS structures via an optimal-transport path, effectively\nreplacing the iterative optimization common in nudged-elastic band or\nstring-method algorithms. TS-GEN delivers unprecedented accuracy, achieving a\nroot-mean-square deviation of $0.004\\ \\rm{\\mathring{A}}$ (vs. $0.103\\\n\\rm{\\mathring{A}}$ for prior state-of-the-art) and a mean barrier-height error\nof $1.019\\ {\\rm kcal/mol}$ (vs. $2.864\\ {\\rm kcal/mol}$), while requiring only\n$0.06\\ {\\rm s}$ GPU time per inference. Over 87% of generated TSs meet\nchemical-accuracy criteria ($<1.58\\ {\\rm kcal/mol}$ error), substantially\noutpacing existing methods. TS-GEN also exhibits strong transferability to\nout-of-distribution reactions from a larger database. By uniting sub-angstrom\nprecision, sub-second speed, and broad applicability, TS-GEN will be highly\nuseful for high-throughput exploration of complex reaction networks, paving the\nway to the exploration of novel chemical reaction mechanisms.",

However, these breakthroughs are mostly reported on the\nQwen2.5 model family and evaluated on well-known benchmarks such as MATH-500,\nAMC, and AIME, while failing to achieve similar gains on other models like\nLlama, which warrants further investigation. Our analysis shows that although\nQwen2.5 achieves strong mathematical reasoning performance, its pretraining on\nlarge-scale web corpora makes it vulnerable to data contamination in popular\nbenchmarks. As a result, results derived from these benchmarks may be\nunreliable. To address this, we introduce a generator that produces fully\nsynthetic arithmetic problems of arbitrary length and difficulty, yielding a\nclean dataset we call RandomCalculation. Using these leakage-free datasets, we\nshow that only accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while\nnoisy or incorrect signals do not. We advocate for evaluating RL methods on\nuncontaminated benchmarks and across diverse model families to ensure\ntrustworthy conclusions.",

Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also\nserve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by\nother models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking\ndifferent LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.\nHowever, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its\neffectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of\ndedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a\nbenchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and\nunit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform\nnon-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even\nrelatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially\ntrained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still\nexhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise\njudging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can\nsubstantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests\nwritten by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in\nperformance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and\nconsistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal\nprompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise\ncomparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining\ncomments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved\njudge performance.",

This is a challenging problem particularly when\nrendering digital avatar close-ups for showing character's facial microfeatures\nand expressions. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads,\nincluding skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple\nlocally-defined facial expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable\ncreating ultra-high fidelity, expressive and photorealistic 3D head avatars. In\ncontrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we\ncondition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and\nsynthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a\npatch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how\nto translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling\nthe patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene\nrepresentation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians\non-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ\ncolor-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality\nresults and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images.

      "abstract": "Recent advanced vision-language models(VLMs) have demonstrated strong\nperformance on passive, offline image and video understanding tasks. However,\ntheir effectiveness in embodied settings, which require online interaction and\nactive scene understanding remains limited. In such scenarios, an agent\nperceives the environment from a first-person perspective, with each action\ndynamically shaping subsequent observations. Even state-of-the-art models such\nas GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro struggle in open-environment\ninteractions, exhibiting clear limitations in spatial reasoning and\nlong-horizon planning. To address this gap, we introduce EmRACE-3K, a dataset\nof over 3,000 language-guided tasks situated in diverse, photorealistic\nenvironments constructed using Unreal Engine and the UnrealCV-Zoo framework.\nThe tasks encompass a wide range of embodied challenges, including navigation,\nobject manipulation, and multi-stage goal execution. Each task unfolds as a\nmulti-step trajectory, pairing first-person visual observations with high-level\ninstructions, grounded actions, and natural language rationales that express\nthe agent's intent at every step. Using EmRACE-3K, we establish a benchmark to\nevaluate the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs across three key\ndimensions: Exploration, Dynamic Spatial-Semantic Reasoning, and Multi-stage\nGoal Execution. In zero-shot settings, all models achieve success rates below\n20%, underscoring the challenge posed by our benchmark and the current\nlimitations of VLMs in interactive environments. To demonstrate the utility of\nEmRACE-3K, we further fine-tune Qwen2.5-VL-7B using supervised learning\nfollowed by reinforcement learning. This approach yields substantial\nimprovements across all three challenge categories, highlighting the dataset's\neffectiveness in enabling the development of embodied reasoning capabilities.",

      "abstract": "Protecting cyberspace requires not only advanced tools but also a shift in\nhow we reason about threats, trust, and autonomy. Traditional cybersecurity\nmethods rely on manual responses and brittle heuristics. To build proactive and\nintelligent defense systems, we need integrated theoretical frameworks and\nsoftware tools. Game theory provides a rigorous foundation for modeling\nadversarial behavior, designing strategic defenses, and enabling trust in\nautonomous systems. Meanwhile, software tools process cyber data, visualize\nattack surfaces, verify compliance, and suggest mitigations. Yet a disconnect\nremains between theory and practical implementation.\n  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI offers a new path to\nbridge this gap. LLM-powered agents can operationalize abstract strategies into\nreal-world decisions. Conversely, game theory can inform the reasoning and\ncoordination of these agents across complex workflows. LLMs also challenge\nclassical game-theoretic assumptions, such as perfect rationality or static\npayoffs, prompting new models aligned with cognitive and computational\nrealities. This co-evolution promises richer theoretical foundations and novel\nsolution concepts. Agentic AI also reshapes software design: systems must now\nbe modular, adaptive, and trust-aware from the outset.\n  This chapter explores the intersection of game theory, agentic AI, and\ncybersecurity. We review key game-theoretic frameworks (e.g., static, dynamic,\nBayesian, and signaling games) and solution concepts. We then examine how LLM\nagents can enhance cyber defense and introduce LLM-driven games that embed\nreasoning into AI agents. Finally, we explore multi-agent workflows and\ncoordination games, outlining how this convergence fosters secure, intelligent,\nand adaptive cyber systems.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) display striking surface fluency yet\nsystematically fail at tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy,\nand logical consistency. This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such\nfailures, revealing a persistent gap between \\textit{comprehension} and\n\\textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis,\nwe demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably\napplying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational\nexecution. We term this phenomenon the computational \\textit{split-brain\nsyndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and\nfunctionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from\nmathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model\nbehavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs\nfunction as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural\nscaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the\nboundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with\nmetacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution.\nThis diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may\nreflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal\ncomputational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction\nand execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and\nmechanistic analysis.",

While it conventionally relies on meticulous feature engineering, deep\nlearning techniques have recently shown a great promise in learning effective\nplayer and team representations directly for soccer outcome prediction.\nHowever, existing methods often overlook the heterogeneous nature of\ninteractions among players and teams, which is crucial for accurately modeling\nmatch dynamics. To address this gap, we propose HIGFormer (Heterogeneous\nInteraction Graph Transformer), a novel graph-augmented transformer-based deep\nlearning model for soccer outcome prediction. HIGFormer introduces a\nmulti-level interaction framework that captures both fine-grained player\ndynamics and high-level team interactions. Specifically, it comprises (1) a\nPlayer Interaction Network, which encodes player performance through\nheterogeneous interaction graphs, combining local graph convolutions with a\nglobal graph-augmented transformer; (2) a Team Interaction Network, which\nconstructs interaction graphs from a team-to-team perspective to model\nhistorical match relationships; and (3) a Match Comparison Transformer, which\njointly analyzes both team and player-level information to predict match\noutcomes. Extensive experiments on the WyScout Open Access Dataset, a\nlarge-scale real-world soccer dataset, demonstrate that HIGFormer significantly\noutperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we provide\nvaluable insights into leveraging our model for player performance evaluation,\noffering a new perspective on talent scouting and team strategy analysis.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as\na powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language\nmodels (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks. However,\nprevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training\ninstability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty\nmismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's\ncurrent capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled\nlearning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more\nresource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid\nPolicy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning\nframework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive\nprompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively\nbalances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's\nreach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks,\neffectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of\napproximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently\noutperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning\nbaselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances\nboth training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a\nscalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning\nmodels.",

This paper\nproposes GeoHopNet, a Hopfield-augmented sparse spatial attention network\nspecifically designed for dynamic UAV site location problems. Our approach\nintroduces four core innovations: (1) distance-biased multi-head attention\nmechanism that explicitly encodes spatial geometric information; (2) K-nearest\nneighbor sparse attention that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$\nto $O(NK)$; (3) a modern Hopfield external memory module; and (4) a memory\nregularization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that GeoHopNet\nextends the boundary of solvable problem sizes. For large-scale instances with\n1,000 nodes, where standard attention models become prohibitively slow (over 3\nseconds per instance) and traditional solvers fail, GeoHopNet finds\nhigh-quality solutions (0.22\\% optimality gap) in under 0.1 seconds. Compared\nto the state-of-the-art ADNet baseline on 100-node instances, our method\nimproves solution quality by 22.2\\% and is 1.8$\\times$ faster.",

This paper\nfocuses on the application of LLMs to switched-mode power supply (SMPS) design\non printed circuit boards (PCBs). Particular challenges for LLMs in this\ncontext include their limited ability to interpret results from key simulation\ntools like SPICE and the multi-step design process. To address these\nchallenges, we suggest SPICEAssistant, a framework that provides a broad\nselection of tools to an LLM. The tools serve as an interface to SPICE,\nallowing the LLM to interact flexibly with the simulator to estimate the impact\nof its modifications to the circuit. To evaluate the performance of\nSPICEAssistant, we defined a benchmark consisting of 256 questions testing the\nability to adapt circuit netlists to fulfil different SMPS design tasks. The\nbenchmarking results show that simulation feedback effectively improves SMPS\ndesign capabilities of LLMs. An increasing number of simulation iterations\nleads to enhanced performance. The SPICEAssistant framework significantly\noutperforms the standalone LLM GPT-4o on the benchmark by approximately 38%.",

Also, since one of the core pretraining objectives is Next\nToken Prediction, these models tends to learn surface-level syntactic patterns\nin code. However, this does not guarantee code comprehension ability i.e. the\nability to capture the semantics of the code. In our opinion, this is the\nreason why these models often underperform on tasks that require deeper\nsemantic understanding, such as code debugging and code optimization. To\naddress this, we propose fine-tuning these models specifically for code\ncomprehension tasks using large-scale datasets, enabling them to develop a more\nrobust understanding of code semantics. We evaluate three code models of\nvarying sizes on a suite of code comprehension tasks designed to assess\nsemantic understanding beyond surface-level syntactic pattern matching. In\nparticular, we analyze performance on the Subjectivity Grading Task and observe\nthat model performance improves after fine-tuning on relevant downstream tasks.\nThe most significant improvement is seen in the QWQ-32B model, where accuracy\nincreases from 70% to 83.47%. A similar or explainable trend is observed across\nother models, clearly indicating an enhancement in code comprehension ability.\nAmong the models studied, the DPO-fine-tuned Codestral-22B achieves the highest\nmicro-accuracy of 87.66% on the Subjectivity Grading Task.",

To\nsystematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic\nfoundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery\nmechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing\nagent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent\nwhere others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift\nin the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic\nWeb) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model\n(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable\nand adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new\nprotocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,\ntrustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies\nin solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda\nfocused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance\nfor the emerging WoA.",

We introduce a\ntwo-dimensional characterization framework that organizes these datasets based\non semantic richness and multimodal alignment, showing underexplored regions in\nthe current data landscape. Simulation environments are evaluated for their\neffectiveness in generating large-scale data, as well as their ability to\nfacilitate transfer from simulation to real-world settings and the variety of\nsupported tasks.

We then exploit\ndifferences in carry functions to probe the inductive biases of neural networks\nin symmetry learning, by training neural networks to carry out base addition\nusing different carries, and comparing efficacy and rate of learning as a\nfunction of their structure. We find that even simple neural networks can\nachieve radical generalization with the right input format and carry function,\nand that learnability is closely correlated with carry function structure.

From a\nglobal perspective, we employ a metric learning strategy to ensure causal\nembeddings adhere to causal principles, separating them from non-causal\nconfounding factors while focusing on the invariance of causal factors. At the\nlocal level, we introduce an instance-level CLIP semantic loss to precisely\nmaintain causal factor consistency. 2) Based on our causal analysis, we present\na wavelet transform-based backbone network that effectively optimizes the\nrecovery of frequency information, ensuring precise enhancement tailored to the\nspecific attributes of wavelet transforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat CWNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across\nmultiple datasets, showcasing its robust performance across diverse scenes.\nCode is available at https://github.com/bywlzts/CWNet-Causal-Wavelet-Network.",

Participants\nconflated the human-like empathy exhibited by LLMs with human-like\naccountability and mistakenly believed that their interactions with these\nchatbots were safeguarded by the same regulations (e.g., HIPAA) as disclosures\nwith a licensed therapist. We introduce the concept of \"intangible\nvulnerability,\" where emotional or psychological disclosures are undervalued\ncompared to more tangible forms of information (e.g., financial or\nlocation-based data). To address this, we propose recommendations to safeguard\nuser mental health disclosures with general-purpose LLM-enabled chatbots more\neffectively.",

To address this,\nwe propose a novel framework that integrates external biological knowledge into\nexisting pretraining strategies to enhance microscopy image profiling models.\nOur approach explicitly disentangles perturbation-specific and cell\nline-specific representations using external biological information.\nSpecifically, we construct a knowledge graph leveraging protein interaction\ndata from STRING and Hetionet databases to guide models toward\nperturbation-specific features during pretraining. Additionally, we incorporate\ntranscriptomic features from single-cell foundation models to capture cell\nline-specific representations. By learning these disentangled features, our\nmethod improves the generalization of imaging models to \\textit{de novo} cell\nlines. We evaluate our framework on the RxRx database through one-shot\nfine-tuning on an RxRx1 cell line and few-shot fine-tuning on cell lines from\nthe RxRx19a dataset.

We then carry out\nmutation on the grammar, rather than on a tune directly. There are potentially\n19 types of mutations such as adding, removing, swapping or reversing parts of\nthe grammar that can be applied to the grammars. The system employs one of the\nmutations randomly in this step to automatically manipulate the grammar.\nFollowing the mutation, we need to expand the grammar which returns a new tune.\nThe output after 1 or more mutations will be a new tune related to the original\ntune. Our study examines how tunes change gradually over the course of multiple\nmutations. Edit distances, structural complexity and length of the tunes are\nused to show how a tune is changed after multiple mutations. In addition, the\nsize of effect of each mutation type is analyzed. As a final point, we review\nthe musical aspect of the output tunes. It should be noted that the study only\nfocused on generating new pitch sequences.

      "abstract": "Thanks to the availability of massive amounts of data, computing resources,\nand advanced algorithms, AI has entered nearly every sector. This has sparked\nsignificant investment and interest, particularly in building data centers with\nthe necessary hardware and software to develop and operate AI models and\nAI-based workflows. In this technical review article, we present energy\nconsumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering\nboth near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and\nbeyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net\npositive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally,\nwe discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive\nworkflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and\nconsumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely\nstrain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and\ntherefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of\nbig data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and\ncomplex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and\napplications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more\npromising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction. Its\nability to further automate and optimize processes across industries, from\nenergy production to logistics, could significantly decrease our carbon\nfootprint. This positive impact is anticipated to outweigh the initial\nemissions bump, creating value for businesses and society in areas where\ntraditional solutions have fallen short. In essence, AI might cause some\ninitial growing pains for the environment, but it has the potential to support\nclimate mitigation efforts.",

An evaluative challenge facing FER\nalgorithms is the fall in performance when detecting spontaneous expressions\ncompared to posed expressions. An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER\nalgorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and\nskin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices\nemployed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two\nstate-of-the-art FER datasets. We take random samples from each dataset and\nexamine whether images are spontaneous or posed. In doing so, we propose a\nmethodology for identifying spontaneous or posed images. We discover a\nsignificant number of images that were posed in the datasets purporting to\nconsist of in-the-wild images. Since performance of FER models vary between\nspontaneous and posed images, the performance of models trained on these\ndatasets will not represent the true performance if such models were to be\ndeployed in in-the-wild applications. We also observe the skin color of\nindividuals in the samples, and test three models trained on each of the\ndatasets to predict facial expressions of people from various races and skin\ntones. We find that the FER models audited were more likely to predict people\nlabeled as not white or determined to have dark skin as showing a negative\nemotion such as anger or sadness even when they were smiling.

The models\nparticularly are based on GraphSAGE, Bidirectional encoder representations from\ntransformers (BERT), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as well as Multi-Head\nAttention, together with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM)\nMulti-Head Attention and BI-LSTM and LSTM models. The chosen models\ndemonstrated great performance to model temporal patterns and detect feature\nsignificance. The observed performance are mainly due to the fact that IoT\nsystem traffic patterns are both sequential and diverse, leaving a rich set of\ntemporal patterns for the models to learn. Experimental results showed that\nBERT maintained the best performance. It achieved 99.94% accuracy rate\nalongside high precision and recall, F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 99.99% which\ndemonstrates its capabilities through temporal dependency capture. The\nMulti-Head Attention offered promising results by providing good detection\ncapabilities with interpretable results. On the other side, the Multi-Head\nAttention model required significant processing time like BI-LSTM variants. The\nGraphSAGE model achieved good accuracy while requiring the shortest training\ntime but yielded the lowest accuracy, precision, and F1 score compared to the\nother models",

We demonstrate that common models can\neffectively classify such data when it is appropriately preprocessed. To do so,\nwe construct four distinct neural network-friendly image formulations along\nwith an additional time-series formulation that explicitly encodes the\nexploration/exploitation of users, which allows for generalizability to other\nabstract tasks. We benchmark the quality of each image formulation across three\nclassical deep learning architectures, along with a parallel CNN-RNN\narchitecture that leverages the additional time series to maximize testing\nperformance, showcasing the importance of encoding temporal and spatial\nquantities for detecting AI aid in abstract tasks.",

      "abstract": "Successful execution of dexterous robotic manipulation tasks in new\nenvironments, such as grasping, depends on the ability to proficiently segment\nunseen objects from the background and other objects. Previous works in unseen\nobject instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which\noften leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results\nin poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution\nscenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the\nprinciple that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We\npropose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that\ncontinuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a\ndesigned body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative\nrotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting\nfrom selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any\nlearned segmentation model. This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline\ngenerates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot\ninteraction without the need to wait for an action to finish. We showcase the\neffectiveness of our proposed interactive perception method by achieving an\naverage object segmentation accuracy rate 27.5% greater than state-of-the-art\nUOIS methods. Furthermore, although rt-RISeg is a standalone framework, we show\nthat the autonomously generated segmentation masks can be used as prompts to\nvision foundation models for significantly improved performance.",

At predefined timepoints called \"decision points,\"\nintelligent mHealth systems such as just-in-time adaptive interventions\n(JITAIs) estimate an individual's biobehavioral context from sensor or survey\ndata and determine whether and how to intervene. For interventions targeting\nhabitual behavior (e.g., oral hygiene), effectiveness often hinges on\ndelivering support shortly before the target behavior is likely to occur.\nCurrent practice schedules decision points at a fixed interval (e.g., one hour)\nbefore user-provided behavior times, and the fixed interval is kept the same\nfor all individuals. However, this one-size-fits-all approach performs poorly\nfor individuals with irregular routines, often scheduling decision points after\nthe target behavior has already occurred, rendering interventions ineffective.\nIn this paper, we propose SigmaScheduling, a method to dynamically schedule\ndecision points based on uncertainty in predicted behavior times. When behavior\ntiming is more predictable, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points closer to\nthe predicted behavior time; when timing is less certain, SigmaScheduling\nschedules decision points earlier, increasing the likelihood of timely\nintervention. We evaluated SigmaScheduling using real-world data from 68\nparticipants in a 10-week trial of Oralytics, a JITAI designed to improve daily\ntoothbrushing. SigmaScheduling increased the likelihood that decision points\npreceded brushing events in at least 70% of cases, preserving opportunities to\nintervene and impact behavior.

Recent nested Transformer architectures mitigate this by embedding\nnested subnetworks within a single model to enable scalable inference. However,\nthese models allocate the same amount of compute to all inputs, regardless of\ntheir complexity, which leads to inefficiencies. To address this, we introduce\nThinkingViT, a nested ViT architecture that employs progressive thinking stages\nto dynamically adjust inference computation based on input difficulty.\nThinkingViT initiates inference by activating a small subset of the most\nimportant attention heads and terminates early if predictions reach sufficient\ncertainty. Otherwise, it activates additional attention heads and re-evaluates\nthe input. At the core of ThinkingViT is our Token Recycling mechanism, which\nconditions each subsequent inference stage on the embeddings from the previous\nstage, enabling progressive improvement. Due to its backbone-preserving design,\nThinkingViT also serves as a plugin upgrade for vanilla ViT. Experiments show\nthat ThinkingViT surpasses nested baselines by up to 2.0 percentage points\n(p.p.) in accuracy at the same throughput and by up to 2.9 p.p. at equal GMACs\non ImageNet-1K.

We\nevaluated the feasibility of using LLMs to replicate expert-driven thematic\nanalysis of social media data. Methods Using two temporally non-intersecting\nReddit datasets on xylazine (n=286 and n=686, for model optimization and\nvalidation, respectively) with twelve expert-derived themes, we evaluated five\nLLMs against expert coding. We modeled the task as a series of binary\nclassifications, rather than a single, multi-label classification, employing\nzero-, single-, and few-shot prompting strategies and measuring performance via\naccuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results On the validation set,\nGPT-4o with two-shot prompting performed best (accuracy: 90.9%; F1-score:\n0.71). For high-prevalence themes, model-derived thematic distributions closely\nmirrored expert classifications (e.g., xylazine use: 13.6% vs. 17.8%; MOUD use:\n16.5% vs. 17.8%).

Second, we provide\nparallel empirical validation with Large Language Models, showing that SC is\ncritical for successful in-context learning in both static (efficient learning)\nand non-stationary (robust adaptation) settings.

A major challenge in offline RL is\ndistributional shift, where the learned policy deviates from the dataset\ndistribution, potentially leading to unreliable out-of-distribution actions. To\nmitigate this issue, regularization techniques have been employed. While many\nexisting methods utilize density ratio-based measures, such as the\n$f$-divergence, for regularization, we propose an approach that utilizes the\nWasserstein distance, which is robust to out-of-distribution data and captures\nthe similarity between actions. Our method employs input-convex neural networks\n(ICNNs) to model optimal transport maps, enabling the computation of the\nWasserstein distance in a discriminator-free manner, thereby avoiding\nadversarial training and ensuring stable learning. Our approach demonstrates\ncomparable or superior performance to widely used existing methods on the D4RL\nbenchmark dataset. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/motokiomura/Q-DOT .",

      "abstract": "Object detection traditionally relies on fixed category sets, requiring\ncostly re-training to handle novel objects. While Open-World and\nOpen-Vocabulary Object Detection (OWOD and OVOD) improve flexibility, OWOD\nlacks semantic labels for unknowns, and OVOD depends on user prompts, limiting\nautonomy. We propose an LLM-guided agentic object detection (LAOD) framework\nthat enables fully label-free, zero-shot detection by prompting a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to generate scene-specific object names. These are passed\nto an open-vocabulary detector for localization, allowing the system to adapt\nits goals dynamically. We introduce two new metrics, Class-Agnostic Average\nPrecision (CAAP) and Semantic Naming Average Precision (SNAP), to separately\nevaluate localization and naming. Experiments on LVIS, COCO, and COCO-OOD\nvalidate our approach, showing strong performance in detecting and naming novel\nobjects. Our method offers enhanced autonomy and adaptability for open-world\nunderstanding.",

While machine learning has been effective in real-time\ndetection of phishing attacks, progress is hindered by lack of large,\nhigh-quality datasets and benchmarks.

In\nthis paper, we introduce PhreshPhish, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of\nphishing websites that addresses these limitations. Compared to existing public\ndatasets, PhreshPhish is substantially larger and provides significantly higher\nquality, as measured by the estimated rate of invalid or mislabeled data\npoints. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive suite of benchmark datasets\nspecifically designed for realistic model evaluation by minimizing leakage,\nincreasing task difficulty, enhancing dataset diversity, and adjustment of base\nrates more likely to be seen in the real world. We train and evaluate multiple\nsolution approaches to provide baseline performance on the benchmark sets.

However, in existing fine-tuning methods, the updated representations\nare formed as a dense combination of modified parameters, making it challenging\nto interpret their contributions and understand how the model adapts to new\ntasks. In this work, we introduce a fine-tuning framework inspired by sparse\ncoding, where fine-tuned features are represented as a sparse combination of\nbasic elements, i.e., feature dictionary atoms. The feature dictionary atoms\nfunction as fundamental building blocks of the representation, and tuning atoms\nallows for seamless adaptation to downstream tasks. Sparse coefficients then\nserve as indicators of atom importance, identifying the contribution of each\natom to the updated representation. Leveraging the atom selection capability of\nsparse coefficients, we first demonstrate that our method enhances image\nediting performance by improving text alignment through the removal of\nunimportant feature dictionary atoms. Additionally, we validate the\neffectiveness of our approach in the text-to-image concept customization task,\nwhere our method efficiently constructs the target concept using a sparse\ncombination of feature dictionary atoms, outperforming various baseline\nfine-tuning methods.",

To enhance the\nrobustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation\nand remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors\nand a contamination ratio of 5%.

However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive\ntraining of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial\ncomputational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training\nefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel\nalignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts\nintractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic\ninversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new\npost-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward\nmodels or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and\nefficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image\ngeneration and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive\nexperiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO\ncompared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the\ntrained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent\nimages. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a\npaired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations\nand comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of\ngenerative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient,\nhigh-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to\ncomplex realistic generation tasks.

It is increasingly integrated into advanced therapeutic\nworkflows, such as hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance\n(PET/MR) imaging and MR-only radiation therapy. These integrated approaches are\ncritically dependent on accurate estimation of radiation attenuation, which is\ntypically facilitated by synthesizing Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR\nscans to generate attenuation maps. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis\nmethods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between\nthe generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for\nreliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D\nWavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by\nperforming modality translation in a learned latent space. By incorporating a\nWavelet Residual Module into the encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance the\ncapture and reconstruction of fine-scale features across image and latent\nspaces. To preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process, we\ndisentangle structural and modality-specific characteristics and anchor the\nstructural component to prevent warping. We also introduce a Dual Skip\nConnection Attention mechanism within the diffusion model, enabling the\ngeneration of high-resolution CT images with improved representation of bony\nstructures and soft-tissue contrast.",

While recent efforts have explored adapting large language\nmodels (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture\none-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer\nspatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In\nthis paper, we present \\textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically\nreprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal\nforecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise\nwhen applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling\ncapacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,\nST-VFM adopts a \\emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs\nwith auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal\ndifference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively\nprocess these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming\nstages. The \\emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token\nAdapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible\nfeature spaces. The \\emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral\nCross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches\nthrough prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning\nwithout modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten\nspatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones\n(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong\ngeneral framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.",

Traditional generative\nmodels based on cloud computing are difficult to meet the real-time\nrequirements of AIGC tasks in IIoT environments, and edge computing can\neffectively reduce latency through task offloading. However, the dynamic nature\nof AIGC tasks, model switching delays, and resource constraints impose higher\ndemands on edge computing environments. To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes an AIGC task offloading framework tailored for IIoT edge computing\nenvironments, considering the latency and energy consumption caused by AIGC\nmodel switching for the first time. IIoT devices acted as multi-agent\ncollaboratively offload their dynamic AIGC tasks to the most appropriate edge\nservers deployed with different generative models. A model aware AIGC task\noffloading algorithm based on Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient\n(MADDPG-MATO) is devised to minimize the latency and energy. Experimental\nresults show that MADDPG-MATO outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an\naverage reduction of 6.98% in latency, 7.12% in energy consumption, and a 3.72%\nincrease in task completion rate across four sets of experiments with model\nnumbers ranging from 3 to 6, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is\nrobust and efficient in dynamic, high-load IIoT environments.",

Like other single deep\nregressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to\nperform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network\nis typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In\norder to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with\nseveral expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset\nwith a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its\nrestoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is\ntrained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image\ncan then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence\nscore. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators\nwhere the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression\ntask. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI)\ndataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB,\nsurpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced\ncomplexity.",

Hebbian learning\npresents a biologically inspired form of neural adaptation that solely relies\non local information. By doing so, we resolve several major challenges for\nlearning heterogeneous control: 1) Hebbian learning removes the complexity of\nattributing emergent phenomena to single agents through local learning rules,\nthus circumventing the micro-macro problem; 2) uniform Hebbian learning rules\nacross all swarm members limit the number of parameters needed, mitigating the\ncurse of dimensionality with scaling swarm sizes; and 3) evolving Hebbian\nlearning rules based on swarm-level behaviour minimises the need for extensive\nprior knowledge typically required for optimising heterogeneous swarms. This\nwork demonstrates that with Hebbian learning heterogeneity naturally emerges,\nresulting in swarm-level behavioural switching and in significantly improved\nswarm capabilities. It also demonstrates how the evolution of Hebbian learning\nrules can be a valid alternative to Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in\nstandard benchmarking tasks.",

This study demonstrates transfer learning between frequency-modulated\ncontinuous wave (FMCW) and impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar systems,\nboth increasingly integrated into consumer devices. FMCW radar utilizes a\ncontinuous chirp, while IR-UWB radar employs short pulses. Our mm-wave FMCW\nradar operated at 60 GHz with a 5.5 GHz bandwidth (2.7 cm resolution, 3\nreceiving antennas [Rx]), and our IR-UWB radar at 8 GHz with a 500 MHz\nbandwidth (30 cm resolution, 2 Rx). Using a novel 2D+1D ResNet architecture we\nachieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.85 bpm and a mean absolute percentage\nerror (MAPE) of 1.42% for heart rate monitoring with FMCW radar (N=119\nparticipants, an average of 8 hours per participant). This model maintained\nperformance (under 5 MAE/10% MAPE) across various body positions and heart rate\nranges, with a 98.9% recall. We then fine-tuned a variant of this model,\ntrained on single-antenna and single-range bin FMCW data, using a small (N=376,\navg 6 minutes per participant) IR-UWB dataset. This transfer learning approach\nyielded a model with MAE 4.1 bpm and MAPE 6.3% (97.5% recall), a 25% MAE\nreduction over the IR-UWB baseline. This demonstration of transfer learning\nbetween radar systems for heart rate monitoring has the potential to accelerate\nits introduction into existing consumer devices.",

We propose a computationally efficient deep\nlearning solution to improve diagnostic accuracy and provide model\ninterpretability for clinical deployment.\n  Methods: A novel lightweight parallel deep architecture is introduced. Each\npipeline processes individual ECG leads using two 1D-CNN blocks to extract\nlocal features. Feature maps are concatenated across leads, followed by LSTM\nlayers to capture temporal dependencies. Final classification employs fully\nconnected layers. Explainability is achieved via Shapley Additive Explanations\n(SHAP) for local/global interpretation. The model was evaluated on a 35-subject\nECG database using standard performance metrics.\n  Results: The model achieved $95.63\\%$ accuracy ($95\\%$ CI: $93.07-98.19\\%$),\nwith sensitivity=$95.10\\%$, specificity=$96.06\\%$, and F1-score=$95.12\\%$.

Model editing methods have emerged as\nefficient solutions for such updates, offering localized and precise knowledge\nmodification at significantly lower computational cost than continual training.\nIn parallel, LLMs are frequently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream\ntasks. However, the effect of fine-tuning on previously edited knowledge\nremains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate how\ndifferent fine-tuning objectives interact with various model editing\ntechniques. Our findings show that edited knowledge is substantially more\nsusceptible to forgetting during fine-tuning than intrinsic knowledge acquired\nthrough pre-training. This analysis highlights a key limitation of current\nediting approaches and suggests that evaluating edit robustness under\ndownstream fine-tuning is critical for their practical deployment. We further\nfind that freezing layers associated with edited content can significantly\nimprove knowledge retention, offering insight into how future editing methods\nmight be made more robust.",

On the other\nhand, the more complex and larger semantic image segmentation models become,\nthe more stressed the devices are when processing data. This paper proposes a\nnovel approach to implementing semantic communication based on splitting the\nsemantic image segmentation process between a resource constrained transmitter\nand the receiver. This allows saving bandwidth by reducing the transmitted data\nwhile maintaining the accuracy of the semantic image segmentation.\nAdditionally, it reduces the computational requirements at the resource\nconstrained transmitter compared to doing all the semantic image segmentation\nin the transmitter. The proposed approach is evaluated by means of\nsimulation-based experiments in terms of different metrics such as\ncomputational resource usage, required bit rate and segmentation accuracy. The\nresults when comparing the proposal with the full semantic image segmentation\nin the transmitter show that up to 72% of the bit rate was reduced in the\ntransmission process. In addition, the computational load of the transmitter is\nreduced by more than 19%. This reflects the interest of this technique for its\napplication in communication systems, particularly in the upcoming 6G systems.",

It leads to a promising question: Can we harness multiple\nopen-source LLMs to match or even beat the closed-source LLMs? To answer this,\nwe propose SMACS, a scalable multi-agent collaboration system (MACS) framework\nwith high performance. Specifically, for continuous integration of new LLMs and\ngeneralization to diverse questions, we first propose a Retrieval-based Prior\nSelection (RPS), which assigns a proxy performance score to each LLM to select\nthe Top-k LLMs at the instance level for any given question. Then, we propose\nan Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE), encouraging the\ngeneration of diverse responses through prior dropping and selecting the\nhigh-quality response via a hybrid posterior score. Experiments on eight\nmainstream benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our SMACS: by integrating\nfifteen open-source LLMs, SMACS outperforms leading closed-source LLMs in 2025,\ne.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet (+12.73%), GPT-4.1(+5.36%) and GPT-o3-mini(+5.28%)\nacross multiple tasks.

      "abstract": "We present ExCyTIn-Bench, the first benchmark to Evaluate an LLM agent x on\nthe task of Cyber Threat Investigation through security questions derived from\ninvestigation graphs. Real-world security analysts must sift through a large\nnumber of heterogeneous alert signals and security logs, follow multi-hop\nchains of evidence, and compile an incident report. With the developments of\nLLMs, building LLM-based agents for automatic thread investigation is a\npromising direction. To assist the development and evaluation of LLM agents, we\nconstruct a dataset from a controlled Azure tenant that covers 8 simulated\nreal-world multi-step attacks, 57 log tables from Microsoft Sentinel and\nrelated services, and 589 automatically generated questions. We leverage\nsecurity logs extracted with expert-crafted detection logic to build threat\ninvestigation graphs, and then generate questions with LLMs using paired nodes\non the graph, taking the start node as background context and the end node as\nanswer. Anchoring each question to these explicit nodes and edges not only\nprovides automatic, explainable ground truth answers but also makes the\npipeline reusable and readily extensible to new logs. This also enables the\nautomatic generation of procedural tasks with verifiable rewards, which can be\nnaturally extended to training agents via reinforcement learning. Our\ncomprehensive experiments with different models confirm the difficulty of the\ntask: with the base setting, the average reward across all evaluated models is\n0.249, and the best achieved is 0.368, leaving substantial headroom for future\nresearch.

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in\nnumerous applications requiring robust long-range capabilities, essential for\nprocessing extensive input contexts and continuously generating extended\noutputs. As sequence lengths increase, the number of Key-Value (KV) pairs in\nLLMs escalates, creating a significant efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we\npropose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free\nmethod for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables\nLLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range\nmodeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without\nrunning out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key\ninnovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only\nsequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from\nshallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range\ndependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range\ncapabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively\ncompresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache\nsize. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective\ncontinuous generation under constrained cache budgets. Experiments across\nvarious tasks, benchmarks, and LLM models consistently validate LaCache's\neffectiveness in enhancing LLMs' long-range capabilities.

This\npaper addresses an optimization problem concerning the purchase and subsequent\nmaterial processing we solved for a meat processing company. Unlike the\nmajority of existing papers, we do not concentrate on how this problem concerns\nsupply chain management, but we focus purely on the production stage. The\nproblem involves the concept of alternative ways of material processing, stock\nof material with different expiration dates, and extra constraints widely\nneglected in the current literature, namely, the minimum order quantity and the\nminimum percentage in alternatives. We prove that each of these two constraints\nmakes the problem \\mbox{$\\mathcal{NP}$-hard}, and hence we design a simple\niterative approach based on integer linear programming that allows us to solve\nreal-life instances even using an open-source integer linear programming\nsolver. Another advantage of this approach is that it mitigates numerical\nissues, caused by the extensive range of data values, we experienced with a\ncommercial solver.

In this\npaper, we extend this framework to RD with three key contributions: (1) we\nsimplify the training via forced alignment and cross-entropy loss instead of\nRNNT loss, (2) we show that word prediction and role prediction require\ndifferent amounts of predictor's context, leading to separate task-specific\npredictors, unlike existing shared-predictor models, and (3) we propose a way\nto leverage RD posterior activity to influence ASR decoding and reduce\nsmall-word deletion errors.",

      "abstract": "Human memory exhibits significant vulnerability in cognitive tasks and daily\nlife. Comparisons between visual working memory and new perceptual input (e.g.,\nduring cognitive tasks) can lead to unintended memory distortions. Previous\nstudies have reported systematic memory distortions after perceptual\ncomparison, but understanding how perceptual comparison affects memory\ndistortions in real-world objects remains a challenge. Furthermore, identifying\nwhat visual features contribute to memory vulnerability presents a novel\nresearch question. Here, we propose a novel AI-driven framework that generates\nnaturalistic visual stimuli grounded in behaviorally relevant object dimensions\nto elicit similarity-induced memory biases. We use two types of stimuli --\nimage wheels created through dimension editing and dimension wheels generated\nby dimension activation values -- in three visual working memory (VWM)\nexperiments. These experiments assess memory distortions under three\nconditions: no perceptual comparison, perceptual comparison with image wheels,\nand perceptual comparison with dimension wheels. The results show that similar\ndimensions, like similar images, can also induce memory distortions.\nSpecifically, visual dimensions are more prone to distortion than semantic\ndimensions, indicating that the object dimensions of naturalistic visual\nstimuli play a significant role in the vulnerability of memory.",
